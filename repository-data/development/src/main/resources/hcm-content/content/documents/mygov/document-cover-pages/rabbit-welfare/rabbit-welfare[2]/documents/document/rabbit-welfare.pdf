Introduction 
 
Rabbits are the most popular pet mammals after dogs and cats in the UK.  
Owning and caring for pet rabbits can be great fun and very rewarding, but it is 
also a big responsibility and a long-term caring and financial commitment.  Your 
rabbits rely on you; it is your responsibility to make sure that their needs are met, 
whatever the circumstances.   
 
Animal owners and keepers must take reasonable steps to ensure the welfare of 
animals for which they are responsible.  Section 24 of the Animal Health and 
Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006 states that: 
 

“A person commits an offence if the person does not take such 
steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to ensure that the 
needs of an animal for which the person is responsible are met to 
the extent required by good practice”. 

 
The Act then specifies that the animal’s needs for which the owner or keeper is 
responsible, include the animal’s: 
 

 need for a suitable environment, 

 need for a suitable diet, 

 need to be able to exhibit normal behaviour patterns, 

 need (if any) to be housed with, or apart from, other animals, 

 need to be protected from suffering, injury and disease. 
 
People are responsible for animals if they own them or manage their care, on a 
permanent or temporary basis.  When a person under 16 years of age is 
responsible for an animal, the person responsible for that young person, for 
example their parent or guardian, is also responsible for their animal.  This 
ensures that an adult can normally be identified as the person responsible for an 
animal.   
 
Responsibility for an animal includes having an understanding of the specific 
health and welfare needs of the animal and having the appropriate knowledge 
and skills to care for the animal properly.  Those responsible for animals will also 
have to be aware of and comply with the legislation, and to know when to seek 
qualified advice and help.  If an owner leaves an animal in the charge of another 
person, responsibility for the animal transfers to that person.  It is up to the owner 
to ensure that the person is competent and has the necessary authority to act in 
an emergency.   
 
This guidance provides more detailed information about the needs of pet rabbits 
and how to meet these needs in accordance with good practice.  Your own 
rabbits might have additional needs that must be met to ensure their welfare.  If 



2 

you are unsure, if you are worried about the health or behaviour of your rabbits, 
or you would like advice about their husbandry or future health care programme, 
you should consult a veterinary surgeon or veterinary nurse competent and 
experienced in rabbit health and treatments.  Your local Scottish SPCA, pet care 
specialist or animal welfare organisation will also be able to advise you on how 
best to meet your rabbits’ husbandry needs.  Some of the main organisations are 
listed in Appendix 2.  
 
This guidance applies to pet rabbits and is intended to support pet rabbit owners 
and others responsible for the care of pet rabbits.  The guidance is not intended 
to apply to pet shops as they are subject to a separate licensing and inspection 
regime, although it may nevertheless provide useful advice.

Section 1: Natural characteristics of rabbits 
 
Domestic rabbits are descended from the wild European rabbit.  Understanding 
the environment, diet and behaviour of this wild species helps us provide a 
suitable diet and environment for domestic rabbits, thus helping to ensure their 
good welfare.  Human-habituated domestic rabbits are of course far more 
adaptable, and can become used to situations which may cause stress to wild 
rabbits, so it is not necessary to provide an environment which exactly replicates 
that experienced by their wild counterparts.  Nevertheless, understanding the 
needs of wild rabbits is a very useful starting point. 
 
Wild European rabbits generally live underground.  They are crepuscular, so are 
most active above ground in the early morning and evening, around dawn and 
dusk.  They will also come above ground at night, but will spend most of the 
daylight hours underground.  Rabbits therefore spend much of their time in dark 
or low light conditions and do not like bright lights, although they will also graze 
and bask in the sun if they are in areas safe from predators. 
 
Rabbits are prey animals whose predators include foxes, dogs, cats, birds of prey 
and stoats.  This affects how and what they eat, how they communicate with 
each other and how they spend their time.   
 
Rabbits eat grasses and other plants, and their teeth and digestive system are 
designed for poor quality, high fibre food.  They slice the grass stems with their 
specially shaped, sharp, front teeth and grind them with their back teeth.  Their 
teeth grow continuously throughout their lives.  Rabbits spend about 70% of the 
time they are awake eating, although most of their food is eaten between 5pm 
and midnight.  
 
Rabbits are social creatures, living in stable groups of between 2 and 10 
individuals.  A close bond forms between individuals within a group and this helps 
the rabbits feel safe and secure and gives them the best chance of survival, 
although during the breeding season rabbits can show aggression towards each 
other.  Amongst the adults of a group there is a hierarchy, in which the dominant 
rabbits get first choice of food, burrow and who should groom them. 
 
Rabbits show very subtle changes in behaviour to indicate when they are in pain 
or are frightened.  Rabbits make a whole variety of sounds including grunts, 
growls, purrs and, if extremely frightened, they will scream.  They also have a 
range of body, face and ear postures that can indicate rank, pleasure, pain, fear 
or aggression.  
 
Scent is an important means of communication for rabbits.  Rabbits rub their chin 
over objects and other rabbits, but this can also include those who handle them.  
Chin marking denotes territory and also acts as a means of identifying members 



4 

of the rabbit’s own group.  It acts both to reassure rabbits that they are amongst 
friends, on home territory, and to deter intruders. 
 
Rabbits also deposit scent with their faeces.  Rabbits pass hard, small droppings 
as they move around, especially when feeding.  Rabbits will scrape the ground 
near the boundaries of their territory and deposit a few droppings there as 
markers.  Rabbits also deposit scent through spraying urine.  Rabbits spray each 
other and, sometimes, people or other animals they live with.   
 
Being a prey species, rabbits are very easily frightened and can remember what 
has frightened them.  In the wild, rabbits can be attacked by birds of prey and by 
other animals on and under the ground.  Thus rabbits are very alert to potential 
danger.  Their first response is to freeze, but if the danger comes too close then 
they will run away to a safe hiding place.  They will also thump the ground with 
their back legs to let other rabbits know of the potential danger.  Only if there is 
no escape route do they tend to fight.  Rabbits can be scared by many things, 
including sudden movements, loud and sudden noises, bright lights and strong 
smells.

Summary rabbit facts: 
 

 Male rabbits are called bucks, females are called does and baby rabbits 
are called kits  

 Rabbits are herbivores (plant eaters), eating mostly high fibre grass and 
other plants 

 Rabbits have continuously growing teeth  

 Rabbits produce soft droppings (caecotrophs) which they normally eat 
directly from their bottoms and then produce hard waste droppings 

 Rabbits are crepuscular, preferring the low light conditions of dawn and 
dusk 

 Rabbits are a prey species, and have many predators e.g. birds of prey, 
foxes, dogs and cats 

 Rabbits are social, so need the company of other rabbits 

 Rabbits are active, so need lots of space to perform all their natural 
behaviours 

 Rabbits are curious, so need mental stimulation 

 Rabbits are fearful, so need places to hide 

 Rabbits in captivity have a life expectancy of 8 to 12 years (can be longer) 

 Adult rabbits will weigh 1 to 10 kg (this varies with breed and sex) 

 A rabbit’s pregnancy lasts for 28 to 34 days 

 The size of a rabbit’s litter depends on the breed of the rabbit.  Generally 
smaller dwarf breeds will have litters of 2-4, medium breeds will have 
litters of 4-6, and larger breeds will have litters of 6-10.  An average litter is 
5-8. 

 Rabbits wean from their mother at 42 to 56 days old 

 Rabbits reach puberty at 4-5 months in small breeds and 5-8 months in 
large breeds. 

 Neutering age for rabbits is usually >3 months for males and >4 months 
for females.  However early neutering at 8-10 weeks of age can be carried 
out where needed, for example in the case of mixed gender pairs where 
there is a risk of early puberty in small breeds.

Section 2: Thinking about keeping rabbits 
 
If you are considering rabbits as pets, there is a lot to think about.  You should do 
your research first, and make sure you know how to care for rabbits and that you 
can meet their welfare needs.  This guidance provides lots of information to help 
you to decide whether or not rabbits are the right pet for you.  It is also a good 
idea to have a pre-purchase consultation with your local vet, who will be happy to 
discuss with you how best to meet the welfare needs of rabbits, and whether or 
not keeping rabbits will suit your lifestyle.  The organisations listed at the end of 
the guidance can also provide information to help you make up your mind. 
 
If you decide to go ahead and give some pet rabbits a home, you’ll want to make 
sure that the rabbits you choose are right for you.  Whether you decide to buy 
rabbits from a reputable pet shop or breeder, or adopt them from an animal 
welfare organisation or rescue centre, the staff should be able to provide you with 
information about the rabbits available, to help you make up your mind.   
 
Importantly, you should be satisfied that the rabbits you are thinking of getting are 
old enough to be rehomed – at least 8 weeks old.  Spend some time observing 
the rabbits.  They should be bright and alert and should not appear stressed or 
lethargic.  Remember, though, that rabbits can be shy, especially with new 
people.  They should have clean eyes, noses, coats and bottoms.  It is good if 
you are able to see them in the environment in which they have been living, as 
this will allow you to see the conditions in which they have been reared, and the 
general health of any other rabbits there. 
 
You should find out as much as you can about the rabbits, such as whether they 
have been vaccinated or had any medical treatment, what they have been fed, 
whether they have any particular likes or dislikes, and whether they are used to 
being handled.  If possible, you should find out what breed they are so you know 
how big they will be when fully grown and what they require in relation to diet, 
husbandry and environment.  Some breeds are particularly predisposed to 
certain health conditions, so it is useful to find out about this before opting for a 
particular breed.  Being able to see the parents, at least the mother, is helpful in 
this regard. 
 
Every animal is different and as you get to know your pets, you will recognise 
their own characteristics.  It is important that you do take this time to get to know 
them, so that you are able to notice any changes in their behaviour which might 
indicate that they are bored, distressed, injured, ill, or in pain, or are not having 
their needs met in some other way.

Section 3: The need for a suitable environment 

 
 

 
Pet rabbits should have access to appropriate places and opportunities to do all 
of the following: 
 

 rest and sleep in comfort 

 eat and drink undisturbed 

 toilet in an appropriate place 

 exercise freely and explore safely 

 hide when afraid or feeling insecure 

 shelter from the weather including wind, cold, draughts, rain and sun 

 keep warm in nesting materials 

 interact with (and escape from) companions 

 play, including chewing and gnawing if they want to 

 mark their scent on solid objects 

 look out for companions or danger 

 dig and forage 
 
This section offers guidance on providing your rabbits with a suitable living 
shelter and exercise area to meet these needs.  The space you need depends on 



8 

the size of your rabbits – and the size they will become.  The minimum total area 
required for 2 average-sized rabbits is 10ft (3m) x 6ft (180cm) x 3ft (90cm) high. 
 
Living shelter 
 
Your rabbits’ shelter should have at least two compartments: a darkened 
sheltered area for sleeping and another for eating / relaxing.  House rabbits 
should be provided with a secure area where they can feel safe, sleep, toilet and 
be kept in when unsupervised. 
 
The shelter should be large enough to allow all your rabbits to perform their 
natural behaviours simultaneously, in order to avoid competition for, and 
monopolisation of, resources.  As a minimum, the shelter should:  

 

 be large enough to allow all your rabbits to lie down and stretch out 
comfortably in all directions, at the same time, 

 be high enough for them to stand up on their back legs without their ears 
touching the top, and 

 be long enough so that they can move around, feed and drink.  As a 
guide, all your rabbits should be able to take a minimum of three big hops 
from one end to another, at the same time. 

 
The minimum recommended size for a suitable shelter for 2 small or medium 
breed rabbits is 6ft x 2ft x 2ft (180cm x 60cm x 60cm).  The size you need will 
depend on the size of your rabbits.  For example, a giant rabbit’s hop can be 4.5ft 
in length, so accommodation for rabbits of this size will have to be much bigger, 
and medium-sized rabbits are likely to need a height of at least 75cm to allow 
them to stand up fully without their ears touching the top. 
 
If your rabbits live outside, their shelter should be sturdy, easy to clean, 
waterproof, raised off the floor, and positioned out of the prevailing weather, sun 
and draughts.  A shed or playhouse fitted with a cat flap or other device which 
allows access to a secure run is ideal accommodation.  A large hutch with 
access to a run is a good alternative, although it should be noted that many of 
the hutches currently on the market provide considerably less space than is 
recommended for 2 rabbits.  If a hutch is used, it should be weatherproof, but can 
also be brought into a shed, building or outhouse for the winter months to provide 
protection from bad weather.   
 
Substrate and Bedding 
 
Your rabbits’ shelter should be lined with appropriate material (substrate) to catch 
urine, faeces, food and water spills, etc.  This substrate layer helps keep the 
shelter hygienic, but it should also be comfortable underfoot.  Suitable materials 
include dust-free, non-toxic wood shavings or shredded paper.  Sawdust is not 
suitable as it  can be very dusty and may cause respiratory problems.   



9 

Your rabbits will spend a significant amount of time on this substrate, so 
choosing the right product can greatly improve their comfort and quality of life. 
 
Bedding, such as dust-free bedding hay or soft straw, should be also provided to 
give your rabbits extra insulation, somewhere to hide, and added comfort.  It 
should be clean and dry and should also be safe for your rabbits to eat if they 
choose to (although their main food should be higher quality feeding hay).   
 

 
 
 
Exercise Area – the run 
 
Rabbits are very active animals and need to be able to exercise appropriately, 
i.e. hop, run and play.  Jumping on and off raised areas, such as platforms or hay 
bales, helps rabbits maintain their bone and muscle strength.  If your rabbits do 
not have enough exercise, their bones can become weak and break, they can 
develop muscle wastage and can become obese.  Lack of exercise can also 
have a detrimental impact on your rabbits’ mental health.   

 
Your rabbits should have access to a safe, enclosed exercise area where they 
can run and jump.  Ideally, this should be attached to the living shelter, so that 
your rabbits have constant access to it.  However, if this is not possible, they 
should have access to their exercise area every day.  If their living area is moved 



10 

indoors in winter, it is important that the exercise area is still available at least 
daily.   
 
The run should be large enough to allow your rabbits to stretch upwards to full 
height without their ears touching the roof, and to run, as opposed to just hop at 
least 3 times.  The minimum recommended size for a run for 2 rabbits is 8ft x 6ft  
and 3ft high (240cm x 180cm by 90cm high), but again the size of your rabbits 
should be considered and a larger run provided for bigger rabbits.   
 
The run should contain raised areas for jumping on to and preferably should be 
outside with access to a grassy area.  It should be escape-proof to the extent that 
your rabbits cannot burrow under the sides of their run.  It should also be secure 
enough to prevent access by rats, or predators such as dogs, cats, foxes and 
birds of prey.  There must be sufficient shelter for all the rabbits to be protected 
from the sun, wind and rain. 
 
Indoors and outdoors: hiding places 
 
Rabbits should be given hiding places where they can run to if they feel afraid, 
stressed, unwell, or simply want to be on their own for a while. Suitable hiding 
places include cardboard or wooden boxes, sections of wide-bore drain pipes 
and shelves that your rabbits can get under.   
 
It is useful if there are a range of options for hiding places, but there should 
always be at least the same number of hiding places, of an appropriate size, as 
there are rabbits. If you have different sized rabbits, it is good idea to provide a 
hiding place that only the smaller rabbit can enter.  Likewise, it is vital to make 
sure that there are two access points in each hiding place, to prevent one rabbit 
trapping another in there, or barring their entry.  It is also a good idea to provide 
one hiding place large enough for all the rabbits to use together, if they want to. 
 
To ensure rabbits feel safe in their hiding place, it is important that they are never 
trapped in them or removed from them. 
 
Ventilation and temperature 
 
It is important to protect your rabbits from bad weather, draughts, extremes of 
temperature and direct sunlight.  In addition to the advice given below, particular 
care may need to be taken if your rabbit is sick or elderly, as they may have 
trouble controlling their body temperature.  Your vet will be able to advise you 
about this. 
 
When housed outdoors, extra bedding material should be provided for added 
warmth on cold nights, and a cover, blanket or piece of old carpet could offer 
added insulation to the shelter.  However, poor ventilation is a common cause of 
respiratory disease. If a hutch cover or blanket is used then it is essential that 



11 

ventilation is maintained by an air inlet at a level above the rabbits’ ears and air 
outlet just under the eaves of the hutch roof in both compartments. Specialist pet 
heat discs can also provide a good source of heat in very cold weather but make 
sure they are securely covered in a material that is thick enough to prevent your 
rabbits coming into direct contact and suffering from any burns.  Specialist heat 
lamps can also be fixed to the outside of the shelter in very cold conditions, but 
extreme care must be taken when using heat sources in close proximity to hay 
and straw.  Hot water bottles are not a good idea, as rabbits can chew through 
them and get burnt.   
 
It is also important to ensure that your rabbits do not get over-heated.  Sheds can 
become very hot if they are in direct sunlight, even in winter, so it is important to 
consider this when deciding where to put your rabbits’ shelter.  The position of 
the shelter and exercise area should take into account the movement of the sun 
and ensure that there is no time at which rabbits are left without the ability to 
escape the heat of the sun. 
 
When housed indoors, the rabbits’ living area should be placed in a cool room, 
away from radiators, out of direct sunlight and draughts.  
 
If your rabbits’ environment becomes very warm and it is not possible to move 
them into a cooler place, cool pads or frozen water bottles can be used to 
prevent overheating, or you can put ceramic tiles on the base of the shelter as a 
cool surface for your rabbits to lie on.  If they do become overheated, you can 
dampen down your rabbits’ ears with a cold wet flannel. 
 
Sudden changes in temperature are not good for rabbits.  It is therefore not a 
good idea for your house rabbits to go out into an uninsulated outdoor run on the 
coldest winter days, having spent the night in a centrally-heated house.  
Likewise, it is not a good idea to bring your outdoor rabbits in to a centrally-
heated house on cold winter nights, and put them back outside during the day.  If 
you get your rabbits in winter, and they have previously been kept in a warm, 
indoor environment, it is important not to put them into an outdoor living area 
unless you are sure that it is properly insulated and that you have provided heat 
sources. 
 
Hygiene  
 
The rabbits’ environment must be kept safe, clean and hygienic.  A toilet area 
should be provided, filled with shredded paper, or dust-free, non-toxic, wood 
shavings or hay.  Alternatively, you can put some of these materials, or other 
non-clumping, not-toxic and non-expanding paper-based litter, into a litter tray.  
Rabbits tend to choose one area to use as a toilet, which makes them fairly easy 
to litter train. 
 



12 

Every day you should remove and replace any wet or dirty litter or bedding, clean 
toilet areas, remove any uneaten fresh foods and thoroughly clean water and 
food containers.  The entire shelter should be cleaned and disinfected at least 
once a week, renewing all bedding and shavings.  It is important that a non-toxic, 
rabbit-friendly disinfectant is used, and that the accommodation is completely dry 
before the rabbits are returned to it.  As cleaning can be stressful for rabbits, it is 
recommended that after cleaning, a small amount of used, but unsoiled, bedding 
and nesting materials be returned to the shelter.  This will smell familiar to the 
rabbits and can help reduce the stress that has been caused by the cleaning 
process. 
 
Exercise areas should be regularly cleaned.  The run can also be moved onto a 
new area, but each area should be cleaned after use. 
 
Protection from hazards 
 
Your rabbits’ environment should be safe, secure and free from hazards.  Their 
shelter and exercise area should be checked regularly for damage, and repaired 
or replaced when necessary.  All areas to which your rabbits have access should 
be ‘rabbit-proofed’, and it is important to contact your vet promptly if you think 
your rabbits have come into contact with anything which could harm them.   
 
If your rabbits have access to your garden, it is important that they are kept away 
from any areas where you have been using herbicides, pesticides, or other 
poisons such as slug pellets.  Likewise, you should not allow your rabbits access 
to flower beds or other areas that are likely to contain poisonous plants.  Further 
information about plants which might be poisonous to your rabbits can be found 
on the RWAF website:  
 
http://rabbitwelfare.co.uk/rabbit-diet/poisonous-plants-rabbits/ 
 
Indoors, you should ensure that any houseplants which might be poisonous to 
rabbits are kept out of reach, and that their petals are not able to drop into an 
area to which your rabbits have access.  Wires and cables should be covered or 
kept out of reach, and you should ensure that your rabbit has no access to any 
potentially dangerous areas (e.g. oven). 
 
Travel 
 
If you need to transport your rabbits anywhere, they should travel in a secure pet 
carrier of adequate size with good ventilation.  The carrier should be secured 
firmly in place with a seat belt, or wedged in the footwell of the car, making sure 
there is adequate ventilation.  You should also ensure that the carrier is not 
placed where your rabbits will become too hot, such as in direct sunlight or next 
to the car’s heating vents.  Do not put the carrier in the enclosed boot of a car.  

http://rabbitwelfare.co.uk/rabbit-diet/poisonous-plants-rabbits/


13 

The pet carrier should be cleaned after each use, and disinfected if necessary, 
especially if it is used for more than one pet. 
 
Rabbits which live together should be transported together in order to maintain 
their bond, and to avoid any problems associated with reintroduction. 
 
Rabbits need to eat continuously due to the way their digestive system works, so 
it is recommended that rabbits are provided with enough hay in their carrier to 
last the journey and should have constant access to fresh, clean water.  Water 
should be provided in a way the rabbits are used to (eg bottle or bowl), and the 
water supply should be checked regularly.  It is also important to ensure that the 
rabbits are continuing to eat normally after a journey.   
 
Rabbits should never be left unattended in a car or other vehicle.  The 
temperature in a parked vehicle can become very high extremely quickly and 
cause heat stroke or even death.   
 
When you are away 
 
You have a responsibility to make sure that your rabbits are cared for while you 
are away.  As many rabbits prefer to stay in a familiar environment, you may wish 
to make suitable arrangements with a neighbour or pet sitter, but you should 
make sure that they can meet all of your rabbits’ needs and any special 
requirements they may have.   
 
Alternatively, you may wish to consider whether a good boarding facility would be 
better, where your rabbits can be monitored and cared for by someone 
knowledgeable on how to look after rabbits.  It is important that you ensure you 
are aware of, and comply with, any health or disease control requirements 
stipulated by the boarding facility.

Section 4: The need for a suitable diet 
 

 
 
 
 



15 

Food 
 
It is your responsibility to ensure that your rabbits are fed an appropriate diet.  
Rabbits are herbivores, which means that they eat plants.  They need a diet that 
is high in fibre to wear down their continuously growing teeth, keep their digestive 
tract functioning properly and help prevent them from becoming bored.  The way 
their digestive system works means that they need to eat continuously, so 
appropriate food should be available to them 24 hours a day. 
 
Your rabbits’ daily diet should consist mainly of large quantities of good quality, 
dust-free feeding hay and/or dried/fresh grass that will provide the necessary 
fibre for the rabbits.  This should make up at least 80% of each rabbit’s daily food 
intake and they should have access to this throughout the day and night.  As a 
guide, an amount equivalent to each rabbit’s body size should be provided each 
day.  However, the amount required will also be dependent on the amount of 
exercise each individual rabbit gets, so it will be important to keep an eye on your 
rabbits over time to make sure they are fit and healthy and do not become over- 
or under-weight (see below).   
 
A small amount of high quality specialist rabbit food such as extruded nuggets or 
pellets should also be given to ensure that the rabbits receive beneficial nutrients 
and minerals that may not always be achieved in the domestic setting via the 
feeding of hay.  However, this should make up no more than 5-10% of their daily 
food intake.  (Current recommended maximum is 25g of nuggets / pellets per kg 
of rabbit per day.) 
 
Muesli-type food has been linked to digestive and dental problems in rabbits so 
should not be used.  If your rabbits are currently fed a muesli diet, it is 
recommended that they be transitioned slowly (over 14-28 days) onto nuggets or 
pellets. 
 
Washed leafy green vegetables, herbs and weeds should also be offered.  
Suitable green plants include broccoli, parsley, watercress, celery leaves and 
kale.  Safe wild plants include chickweed, bramble, raspberry, blackberry and 
strawberry leaves, and dandelions.  Twigs from non-toxic trees that have not 
been treated with pesticides can be provided for environmental enrichment, to 
allow your rabbits to remove the bark as they would in the wild.  
  
You should always make sure you know the identity of any plant, and that it is 
suitable for rabbits, before providing it as food. (Again, the RWAF webpage about 
poisonous plants is useful here – see page 12.)  When foraging for plants, it is 
important to avoid those growing on the sides of roads, as they could be 
contaminated with exhaust fumes, and to ensure that they are free from 
herbicides and pesticides.  Lawnmower clippings should never be given to 
rabbits, as these can upset their stomachs and make them very ill, even causing 
death if they are not treated immediately by a vet. 



16 

Rabbits can suffer from obesity, and teeth and gut problems, caused by 
inappropriate diets and overfeeding.  Although we often think of rabbits eating 
carrots, these are not suitable as part of their daily diet.  Root vegetables and 
fruit can be provided to your rabbits, but they should only be given occasionally 
and in small quantities as they can be high in sugar.  Don’t give your rabbits too 
many special rabbit treats, and sticky, sugary treats should be avoided as they 
can harm a rabbit’s teeth and also lead to obesity.  Foods and treat items which 
contain ingredients such as seeds, nuts and corn can pose a choking hazard and 
risk of gut impaction so should be avoided. 

 

 

 

 
 

This looks cute, but you should always make sure you have enough feeding 
points for all your rabbits so they don’t have to crowd around one.



17 

Rabbits are very sensitive to any change in their diet so any alterations must be 
introduced gradually.  When introducing new foods, it is a good idea to introduce 
them one at a time and provide only small quantities, so you can monitor your 
rabbits for any ill-effects.  This is especially important when weaning rabbits and 
introducing them to green plants.   
 
Place all food and fresh water well away from your rabbits’ toilet area.  Any food 
that has gone mouldy should be removed as soon as it is discovered. 
 
Water 
 
Your rabbits must always have access to fresh, clean water.  This can be 
provided in either a metal-tipped feeding bottle, a water bowl, or both.  Some 
rabbits have a strong preference for one or the other, so when you first bring your 
rabbits home, it is a good idea to offer water in both a bowl and a feeding bottle 
to find out which they prefer.  (Research suggests most rabbits prefer bowls and 
will drink more if a bowl is provided.)  If water is presented in a new, unfamiliar 
way, your rabbits might refuse to drink and become dehydrated.   
 
Both bowls and bottles should be checked at least twice daily to ensure that 
sufficient fresh, clean water is always available.  In cold weather, make sure that 
the water has not frozen.  In warmer weather, make sure that algae has not built 
up.  Both bottles and bowls should be cleaned and refilled daily.  Bottles should 
be checked for leaks and air blocks, and to make sure that the water is coming 
out of them properly. If bowls are your rabbits’ preferred option, it is a good idea 
to have more than one available, and to use heavy, ceramic bowls, so they are 
less likely to be knocked over. 
 
Rabbits on a largely dry diet should drink around 50-100ml of water per kilogram 
of rabbit per day.  You should keep an eye on your rabbits’ water consumption, 
as any increase can be a sign of ill health requiring veterinary attention. 
 
Droppings 
 
Rabbits maximise the nutrition they get from their food by passing partially 
digested food out of their bodies as soft pellets (called caecotrophs), which they 
then eat and re-digest.  The caecotrophs contain lots of essential vitamins and 
protein and rabbits should not be discouraged from eating them. If these 
caecotrophs become very runny, there’s a change in their appearance, you start 
seeing lots of them (suggesting that your rabbit is not eating them) or your rabbit 
stops producing them, veterinary advice should be sought. Rabbits also produce 
hard brown round droppings that they do not usually eat. Again, if fewer hard 
brown round droppings than normal are being produced, this may indicate ill 
health, and veterinary advice should be sought.

Healthy weight 
 
Your rabbits should not be too fat or too thin.  Ideally you should easily be able to 
feel their ribs.  Female rabbits will often have large dewlaps under their chin even 
if they are not overweight, and this is normal.  Adjust how much you feed your 
rabbits to make sure that they do not become over or underweight.  Obese 
rabbits can find it difficult to groom themselves or eat their caecotrophs, which 
can lead to flystrike (See section 7).  Ensuring that they have enough space to 
exercise in will also contribute to their maintaining an appropriate bodyweight. 
 
The pictures on the following page provide a useful reference guide.   
 
Other Dietary Needs 
 
Sometimes rabbits have different dietary needs, such as when they are very 
young or old, or recovering from an illness or if they are pregnant.  Your vet will 
be able to advise you about this.

Section 5: The need to be able to exhibit normal behaviour patterns 
 

 
 
Rabbits have several specific behavioural needs which relate to their natural 
environment and their status as prey animals.   
 
Early experiences 
 
Some rabbits are naturally more confident than others.  However, the way each 
rabbit behaves is largely influenced by experiences during the first few weeks of 
life.  Rabbits which have not had early experiences with humans or other pets 
may find it difficult to cope with being in a normal home environment.  They may 
be very nervous, hiding away a great deal of the time.  Sometimes this may lead 
to fear-related aggression towards their owners. 
 



21 

Once your new rabbits are home, you should gradually introduce them to the 
different people they will come into contact with, normal sights and sounds, and 
to being handled, but always ensuring they have a safe place to which they can 
freely retreat.  They should never be forced to interact, or chased if they try to 
retreat. 
 
Rabbits should be lifted, where necessary, by holding their chest and supporting 
their hind legs firmly, keeping them upright or in a horizontal position. They 
should not be held or laid on their back to produce a “trance” as although rabbits 
may appear be relaxed in this position, they are likely to be stressed and may 
struggle when recovering. They should never be lifted by their ears.  
 
Young children should not try to lift rabbits as rabbits can easily be injured when 
struggling to escape.  A better idea is for young children to sit on the ground and 
wait for the rabbits to hop over to them.  If older children are handling the rabbits, 
they should be carefully supervised. 
 
Generally, rabbits that are well “socialised” at an early age will be better able to 
cope confidently with most new situations and people.  If your rabbits are likely to 
come into contact with cats, dogs or other animals it is important to introduce 
them gradually and in a positive way at an early age.  Never leave your rabbits 
alone with a cat or dog, even if they are familiar with each other.  
 
You should supervise the introduction of any new toy, object or person to make 
sure that your rabbits are not frightened or stressed by its presence and provide 
them with the opportunity to escape to a safe hiding place.  Forcing your rabbits 
to interact with this new object or person may lead to behavioural problems.  
 
Rabbits which are roughly handled at any age may subsequently find all human 
contact distressing.  Never shout at or punish your rabbits.  They will not 
understand and can become more nervous and scared.  If your rabbits’ 
behaviour becomes an on-going problem, seek expert advice.  
 
Getting away from danger 
 
It is natural for rabbits to hide from a real or perceived danger as well as from 
stressful circumstances, such as noise, the presence of other animals or small 
children.  Therefore, your rabbits should each have easy access to a secure 
hiding place (such as a wide tube, cardboard box or secluded part of the living 
area). To ensure these remain safe and secure, rabbits should never be trapped 
in or forcibly removed from their hiding places. 
 
 
 
 
 



22 

Signs of stress 
 
Rabbits that are feeling content will appear calm and relaxed.  They will nibble 
food, sit or lie stretched out and will be happy to approach and interact with their 
companion rabbits, people and objects. 
 
Rabbits respond to stress in different ways.  In most cases, when rabbits are 
feeling scared they prefer to run away to a quiet and hidden location.  This is 
normal behaviour, but is reason for concern if it happens more than just once in a 
while.  It is very important that rabbits have somewhere to hide.  A rabbit which is 
scared but cannot get away to a safe place, or which is trapped or grabbed, may 
resort to biting.  More general signs of stress may include: aggressiveness, 
restlessness, nervousness, lack of interest in food, excessive grooming, and 
maladaptive repetitive behaviour (repeated movements without purpose).  It is 
important that you are able to recognise signs of stress or illness in your rabbits.  
If you are ever concerned, you should always contact your vet. 
 
Typical things that can make your rabbits stressed include: boredom, lack of 
space, too many animals in the same space, loss of a companion, sudden 
noises, the presence of predators or unfamiliar people, or inability to perform 
normal behavioural patterns, such as running or digging.   
 
Boredom and Frustration 
 
Rabbits rely on you to provide everything for them, including entertainment.  You 
should ensure that your rabbits have enough mental and physical stimulation 
from you and from their environment to avoid boredom and frustration.  A rabbit 
with nothing to do will quickly become unhealthy, unhappy and possibly 
aggressive. 
 
You should provide your rabbits with the opportunity to be mentally and 
physically stimulated.  Suggestions include: 

 

 foraging for food and having suitable objects to play with.  Rabbits are 
inquisitive animals and should be given the opportunity to investigate and 
spend time with unfamiliar items that are safe for them to chew. 
 

 the company of another rabbit or rabbits (See section 6). 
   

 providing your rabbits with suitable materials that allow digging behaviour 
and areas to mark their territory with chin secretions, urine and droppings.  
 

 
 
 
 



23 

Crepuscular activity 
 
Rabbits are naturally most active in the early morning and evening, around dawn 
and dusk as well as overnight.  These may be times when owners are not 
available to let their rabbits out into their run or activity area.  In this case, it is 
important that the rabbits’ living area should be attached to a run, so that the 
rabbits can access their run whenever they want to. 
 
 



24 

Section 6: The need to be housed with, or apart from, other animals 
 

 
 
Rabbits are social animals and should be kept with an appropriate companion.  If 
a rabbit is left on its own for long periods of time, it may feel frustrated and its 
behaviour may change to reflect this stress.  Bonded pet rabbits spend more time 
grazing, resting and playing than solitary pet rabbits, which spend the majority of 
their time on watch for predators. 
 
Appropriate Companions 
 
An appropriate companion is a compatible neutered rabbit of a similar size.  
Ideally, rabbits will be kept together in groups familiar from birth.  Litter mates of 
either sex are usually ideal companions, as long as they are neutered.  
Otherwise, a good combination is often a neutered male and a neutered female, 
as bonding neutered rabbits of the opposite sex is usually easiest.  However, two 
females can live happily together if bonded at a young age and neutered at 
puberty.   
 
Rabbits and guinea pigs should not be kept together.  They have different dietary 
requirements and ways of communicating, and, more importantly, living with 
rabbits can be dangerous for guinea pigs.  The powerful hind legs of even a small 
rabbit could cause serious internal injury to a guinea pig.  Rabbits also carry the 



25 

bacteria, Bordetella, which can be passed on via respiratory secretions and is the 
most common cause of respiratory disease in guinea pigs.   
 
However, this is relatively new advice as rabbits and guinea pigs have historically 
been kept together.  In cases where existing rabbit / guinea pig relationships are 
in place, it is not recommended that they be separated.  However, their living 
environment should allow all those living in the shelter / hutch to easily escape 
the other(s) to allow for some time alone.  In particular, it is important that the 
guinea pig has access to a hiding place that the rabbit cannot enter.  They should 
also be closely monitored when eating, or fed separately, to ensure that the 
guinea pig gets the correct nutrition. It is a good idea to get the rabbit neutered as 
this can reduce unwanted behaviours, eg bullying, mounting etc. 
 
Rabbits instinctively fear other animals such as dogs, cats, birds of prey and 
even people.  Through careful training and very sensitive handling, pet rabbits 
can learn to enjoy the companionship of people. 
 
Introducing and keeping rabbits together 
 
Ideally, your rabbits will have known each other since birth.  However, sometimes 
it is necessary to bring together rabbits who are unfamiliar to each other.  A 
successful relationship between two or more rabbits will depend on a number of 
important factors.  The following need to be considered when pairing rabbits 
together as potential companions: 
 

 how, where and when they are introduced 

 their gender (male or female) 

 whether they are neutered or not 

 the age that they are introduced 

 their individual personalities 

 their relative size – a smaller or younger one could be injured or bullied by 
a larger or older companion 

 their relative temperaments – one might be more temperamentally inclined 
to bully the other. 

 
Introductions between unfamiliar rabbits can be very stressful and are not always 
successful.  It is usually best to take a gradual approach, over a period of a few 
weeks.  It is a good idea to consult your vet for further advice before introducing a 
new rabbit into your home. 
 
Suitable Accommodation 
 
When kept in pairs or groups, the size of the accommodation will need to be 
large enough to allow all the rabbits to perform all their natural behaviours.  This 
includes having multiple resources so they are able to perform the same 
behaviours simultaneously.  For example, make sure your rabbits all have places 



26 

they can go to get away from their companions if they want to.  However, it is 
important that these resources don’t take up so much space that they prevent the 
rabbits from moving around comfortably. 
 
Separating Bonded Companions 
 
It is always preferable not to separate a bonded pair of rabbits.  However, if your 
rabbits do have to be separated for any reason, such as being hospitalised, you 
should take care when re-introducing them to each other to minimise the risk of 
fighting and other welfare problems.  Ideally, your vet should allow for your 
rabbit’s companion to accompany them during any vet visit / stay to avoid their 
bond being broken. This offers comfort and security to both animals, and a 
quicker recovery for the ailing rabbit through the support of its companion. 
 



27 

Section 7: The need to be protected from suffering, injury and disease 
 

 
 
Health care 
 
As the person responsible for your rabbits’ welfare you should consider: 
 

 Prevention of disease: there are annual vaccines that are designed to 
protect rabbits from diseases such as Myxomatosis and Viral 
Haemorrhagic Disease (including the new strain VHD2).  Both of these 
diseases are usually fatal and your rabbits should be vaccinated.  Your 
veterinary surgeon can provide information on the prevention of other 
diseases, depending on whether your rabbits are indoor or outdoor 
rabbits. 
 

 Provision of a healthy balanced diet (see Section 4) 
 

 Provision of the right environment that minimises the risk of injury and 
disease, and allows your rabbits to perform all their natural behaviours 
(see Sections 3 and 5) 
 

 Prompt action if a rabbit becomes ill, is injured or in pain, or shows a 
change in its behaviour 



28 

 

 Observation and handling your rabbits daily 
 

 Regular check-ups with your vet. 
 
Your vet is best placed to advise you about routine health care for your rabbits, 
such as neutering, vaccination, internal and external parasite control as well as 
any health problems your rabbits may have.  You may wish to consider taking out 
pet insurance, to cover any unexpected vet bills. 
 
The Rabbit Welfare Association and Fund (RWAF) produces a list of veterinary 
practices which demonstrate a good knowledge of rabbit care.  You can find the 
nearest one to you by visiting the RWAF website and entering your postcode: 
http://rabbitwelfare.co.uk/rabbit-care-advice/rabbit-friendly-vets/rabbit-friendly-vet-
list/.  In addition to those on the RWAF list, a number of unlisted Scottish 
veterinary surgeries also provide care for rabbits, and can be found through an 
internet search. 
 
Suffering 
 
You should be aware of the signs that indicate your rabbits are not well, and 
consult a vet if your rabbits show any signs of illness, injury, pain or a change in 
their behaviour.   
 
Rabbits are prey animals and, to avoid attracting attention from predators, they 
often do not look ill until they are very unwell.  It is important that you get to know 
your rabbits and familiarise yourself with their normal behaviour, so you can spot 
any subtle changes.  They can become worse very quickly, so you need to act 
promptly.  If your rabbit is not eating or not passing faeces, this should be treated 
as an emergency requiring immediate veterinary attention. 

 
Indications of suffering may include: 
 

 a change in behaviour, such as: 
 

o sitting still in hunched posture; 
o becoming apprehensive, anxious or aggressive; 
o increases in activity (ie restlessness) or decreases in activity (ie 

apathy); 
o increases in struggling when handled; 
o increases in abnormal behaviour (eg fur pulling, chewing parts of 

shelter etc); 
o scratching, licking or tooth grinding; 
o changes in respiratory rate (ie laboured or hyperventilation); 
o excessive scratching, licking or biting of areas of the body;

http://rabbitwelfare.co.uk/rabbit-care-advice/rabbit-friendly-vets/rabbit-friendly-vet-list/


29 

o over-reaction to people (ie increased attempts to hide, attempts to 
escape etc); 
 

 a change in appearance, such as: 
 

o pale eyes; 
o generally dull appearance; 
o unkempt due to lack of grooming / fur standing on end; 
o excessive grooming leading to baldness and sore patches; 
o dilated pupils; 
o flattened ears; 

 

 potential signs of abdominal pain, such as: 
 

o increased guarding of body areas to prevent them being touched; 
o flinching or full body flexing (jerking upwards for no apparent 

reason); 
o squealing / crying; 
o twitching (rapid movement of fur on back); 
o belly pressing (pressing stomach into the floor); 
o writhing (contraction of sides of the abdomen / flanks); 
o abnormal locomotion (eg staggering, shuffling or abnormal walking 

or hopping); 
o falling over unexpectedly when moving; 
o wincing / drawing back (rapid backwards movement in rocking 

motion); 
o back arching (arching upwards and contracting stomach); 
o tucked abdomen; 
o reluctance to rear up on hind legs; 

 
 

 a change in eating and drinking habits, such as increased or decreased 
appetite or thirst; 
 

 a change in droppings: smaller, darker, fewer, runny or none; 
 

 uneaten caecotrophs; 
 

 signs of injury such as a swollen limb, guarding or limping;  
 

 signs of disease such as a discharge from the eye, ear or nose, difficulty in 
going to the toilet or diarrhoea; 
 

 drooling or staining on the chin or chest; 
 



30 

 difficulties in breathing, especially if your rabbit is trying to breathe through 
its mouth rather than its nose; 
 

 redness of skin around belly, bottom or on underside of feet; 
 

 difficulty in feeding and / or drinking. 
 
The sources of these indicators can be found in Appendix 3. 
 
The pictures below show some of the ways your rabbits might behave if they are 
in pain.        

 

 
Arching 

 

 
Hunching

Changes in your rabbit’s facial expression may also be a sign that it may be in 
pain.  The following pictures (known as a ‘Grimace Scale’) show some signs to 
look out for.  As this scale is still under development, we advise that it should be 
used alongside the other indicators set out above, rather than in isolation.  It 
should also only be used when your rabbit is fully awake.   
 
This scale was developed by the Pain & Animal Welfare Sciences (PAWS) group 
at Newcastle University. Further information on this grimace scale can be found 
in Appendix 3. 
 
You should consult your vet if your rabbit is showing any signs that it is in 
pain.

Routine Health Check 
 
You should check your rabbits regularly for signs of ill health, and consult your 
vet if you find any.  Listed below are the main health checks you should 
undertake.  It is important that anyone caring for your rabbits understands the 
importance of these checks, and that daily care is about more than simply 
feeding, watering and cleaning. 
 
Daily Checks 
 
Behaviour – watch your rabbits at least once a day to ensure they are behaving 
normally as well as eating and drinking their usual amount. 
 
Feet – check for bald patches and sores. 
 
Fur – check for parasites, dandruff, patches of baldness, itchy sores, scaly 
patches, damp or weeping patches and wounds. 
 
Eyes – ensure they are clear and not weeping.  Runny eyes are often signs of 
respiratory infection which can easily turn into pneumonia. 
 
Nose – ensure it is not runny.  A runny nose is often a sign of respiratory 
infection which can easily turn into pneumonia. 
 
Mouth – rabbits are obligatory nose breathers, so any sign that they are 
attempting to breathe through their mouth is a sign that they are having trouble 
breathing through their nose and should be treated as an emergency.  Also 
check for a wet chin or drooling.  As rabbits are very clean animals it may not be 
easily spotted.  However, the fur on their chest and front paws may be stained 
with drool which can be a sign of a painful mouth, and should be checked by your 
vet.  
 
Ears – check for crusty wax, lumps around the ears, excessive scratching, 
scratch marks, scabs or flaky skin, head shaking or odours. 
 
Droppings – check they have not changed in appearance or reduced in number 
 
Bottom and tail – check your rabbits’ bottoms, and around the tail area, as well 
as the floor of its living area, for signs of diarrhoea or maggots.  A rabbit with 
diarrhoea or maggots should be seen by a vet immediately. 
 
Body – check for any lumps 
 
 
 
 



34 

Weekly checks 
 
Nails – check that they are an appropriate length and not damaged. 
 
Teeth – ensure that incisors are an appropriate length and shape. 
 
 
Fly Strike 
 
During warm weather, rabbits should be checked at least twice daily underneath 
and around the bottom and tail area for droppings stuck in their fur.  Having a 
dirty bottom can increase the risk of a condition known as “fly strike” which can 
kill a rabbit in a matter of hours.  Fly strike occurs when flies lay their eggs in the 
rabbit’s dirty fur.  The hatched maggots eat into the rabbit’s flesh, causing severe 
damage and releasing toxins.  This may produce shock, severe illness and even 
death.  
 
You should contact your vet immediately if you find maggots on your rabbits.  
 
If one of your rabbits is having problems with soiling itself you should: 

 

 ensure its fur is clean 

 ensure the floor of its living area is clean 

 ensure there is plenty of fibre (such as hay or fresh grass, but not 
lawnmower clippings) in your rabbits’ diet 

 reduce the amount of vegetables and fruit in the diet 

 seek veterinary advice immediately 
 
Weight 
 
It is a good idea to check and record your rabbits’ weight at least once a month.  
Loss of weight may indicate a dental or other health problem.  Being overweight 
or obese will cause your rabbits to suffer.  Potential problems may include: 

 

 painful stress on their joints 

 sore feet 

 a decreased ability to exercise 

 heat stress 

 inadequate diet as they are unable to reach to catch the soft pellets from 
their bottom that they need to eat in order to get all the goodness from 
their food 

 fly strike as the rabbit cannot clean itself properly 
 
 
 
 



35 

Grooming 
 
Rabbits naturally moult at the end of the winter and summer but our varying 
temperatures, as well as central heating, means that many rabbits are constantly 
moulting (shedding fur).  Regular grooming is needed to keep your rabbits 
comfortable and prevent them swallowing lots of fur when they clean themselves 
as this can cause a blockage of the gut.  Rabbits with a short coat should be 
groomed weekly but longhaired rabbits should be groomed at least once a day to 
avoid matting and tangles.  Longhaired rabbits can also be clipped by a vet or pet 
care specialist.  
 
Nails 
 
Your rabbits’ nails should be kept at an appropriate length, and should not 
protrude much further than the fur on the feet.  Rabbits’ nails wear down naturally 
when they exercise on harder surfaces or when digging.  How often your rabbits’ 
nails need to be trimmed depends on where your rabbit is kept.  If you are 
concerned about your rabbits’ nails, you should consult your vet. 
 
Dental Care 
 
Your rabbits’ teeth will grow continuously throughout their life.  Dental health 
relies on a diet high in hay and grass which will wear down their teeth as they 
chew.  
 
Check your rabbits’ front teeth to make sure that they are not misaligned or 
overgrown.  Some breeds of rabbit are more prone than others to having dental 
problems because of the way their skulls are formed.  Only a vet should correct 
misaligned or overgrown teeth.  It is sensible to ask your vet to check teeth at 
your annual check-up, but if you spot anything unusual in between check-ups, 
you should consult your vet straight away 
 
Back teeth can be misaligned and grow sharp spurs which can cause severe 
pain to your rabbits when they eat.  They cannot be seen easily and should be 
checked by your vet by otoscope exam, ideally every 6 months.  If a more in-
depth examination requiring sedation or anaesthesia is needed your vet should 
be able to advise you.  
 
Dental problems can cause a poor appetite, a wet chin or drooling.  Your rabbit 
might be in a lot of pain and might stop eating completely.  If your rabbits are 
showing any of these symptoms you should take them to see your vet 
immediately.  
 
 
 
 



36 

Neutering 
 
One particularly important consideration is getting your rabbits neutered.  This 
will not only prevent any unwanted baby rabbits but provides other advantages.  
Rabbits that are not neutered may develop problematic behaviour and may also 
suffer health problems.  
 
If a female rabbit is not neutered she can: 
 

 be aggressive to other rabbits 

 try to make a nest by excessive digging, which can damage her nails 

 have a risk of developing a life-threatening womb infection or, more 
commonly, cancer 

 have phantom pregnancies, which can be emotionally frustrating and 
cause the rabbit to pluck her fur to make a nest.  Nests should not be 
disturbed or removed until the phase has passed as the rabbit will 
continue to pluck fur from her chest area to build another. 

 
If a male rabbit is not neutered he can: 
 

 be aggressive to other rabbits 

 spray urine 

 mount other rabbits and animals 

 (more rarely) develop testicular infections or cancer. 
 
(Points 1-3 above can also be part of normal rabbit behaviour.  However, some 
rabbits may exhibit excessive troublesome behaviours, and neutering may 
reduce these activities.) 
  
Rabbits are very sociable animals, and should be provided with a companion 
(see Section 6).  Animals that have not been neutered might not be able to be 
kept with other rabbits.  The age when rabbits can be neutered varies with the 
rabbit’s gender and breed.  Females are usually neutered when they reach 
sexual maturity at the age of 4 months and males at the age of 3 months. 
 
Allowing your rabbits to breed is not recommended, given the numbers of 
domestic rabbits that are already in need of homes.  However, if you are 
considering breeding from your rabbits, you need to make sure that the welfare 
needs of the parents and their potential offspring are met.  Consult your vet as 
necessary.  You should ensure you have found suitable homes for the baby 
rabbits and you should avoid unplanned pregnancies.  
 
From the age of 4 months, a female rabbit can produce between 2 to 12 babies 
per litter (an average of 5-8), and can become pregnant again soon after she has 
given birth.  If kept with an un-neutered male, the female may have 6 litters a 
year, potentially 72 babies. 



37 

The pros and cons of whether to neuter your rabbits, as well as timing, should be 
discussed with your vet.  
 
Wild Rabbits 
 
Your rabbits should not have contact with wild rabbits or areas where wild rabbits 
have been because of the risk of disease spread. 
 
Medication 
 
Some medicines used for humans and other animals can be very dangerous to 
rabbits.  Only use medicines that have been specifically prescribed or 
recommended for your rabbits by a vet.   
 
Identification 
 
You should not allow your rabbits to escape.  However, it is a good idea to 
permanently identify your rabbits with a microchip just in case they do get out.  
Microchipping should only be done by a suitably qualified person, eg a veterinary 
surgeon.  It is important that your contact details are kept up to date on the 
microchip database.   
 
What to do if one of your rabbits is missing 

You should contact local authority animal wardens, vets and local animal rescue 
centres.  You can also put notices in local shops or newspapers, and use social 
media to ask people to look out for your rabbit.  Once your rabbit has been found 
any notices that you have put up should be removed.
