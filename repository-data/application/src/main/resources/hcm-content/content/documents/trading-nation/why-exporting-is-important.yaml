        <p>Exporting helps Scotland’s economy to grow and creates jobs. It helps the Scottish Government collect more tax to:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>improve living standards</li>
        <li>improve public services</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Exporting also helps Scotland build good relationships with other countries. This can help Scotland to have a positive influence on the world.</p>
        <h2>How exporting helps businesses</h2>
        <p>Exporting helps businesses to grow because it:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>leads them to create new products and services</li>
        <li>makes them more productive</li>
        <li>gives them more customers to sell to</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>New products and services</h2>
        <p>Exporting can mean that businesses have more competitors.</p>
        <p>But this can be a positive thing and can lead them to develop new products and services.</p>
        <p>Businesses that export tend to spend more money on research and development. This helps them to develop new products and services to sell.</p>
        <h2>Improving productivity</h2>
        <p>Exporting helps businesses to become more productive. This means they produce more with the same amount of resources.</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/">Office of National Statistics</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-business-energy-and-industrial-strategy">Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy</a> say:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>businesses that export make up 60% of the UK’s annual increase in productivity</li>
        <li>the 3% of businesses in Scotland that export are on average 70% more productive than businesses that do not</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>More customers to sell to</h2>
        <p>Exporting also means businesses do not have to rely on a particular set of customers. This helps businesses to spread any risks.</p>
        <p>For example, if sales drop in one market, the risk to their business might be less if they have other markets they sell to.</p>
        <h2>Scotland’s export growth plan</h2>
        <p>Because exporting is important to Scotland and its businesses, the Scottish Government has created an export growth plan. This plan is called <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotland-a-trading-nation/">A Trading Nation</a>.</p>
