Our Application Processing department are responsible for carrying out quality assurance checks on all application forms received. Unnecessary delays to 
processing applications are caused by mandatory fields being omitted from an application form or where completed fields have been endorsed incorrectly. 
Please note that all mandatory fields are highlighted in yellow on the application form and MUST be completed. This guide has been created to help identify 
the most common errors and how to avoid these, it also includes a list of ‘Do’s and Don’ts’, a breakdown of what information each field should contain and a 
CSG checklist for you to refer to before submitting an application to Disclosure Scotland. 
 

 

DO DON’T 
Make a note of the application form number (the 16 digit number printed under the 
barcode in the top right hand corner on the front of the form) for enquiry purposes. 
Note that this is not the same as the PVG Scheme membership number which will be 
printed on a disclosure record when it is issued. 

Don’t place any stamps or stickers on the form, (e.g. those featuring Registered body 
details). 

Ensure all fields have been completed unless guidance notes suggest otherwise. 
Mandatory fields are highlighted in yellow and must be completed. 

Don’t write over the edges of the boxes. 

Ensure all choices in the boxes are indicated by a cross [X], not a [✓]. Don’t submit any scanned, downloaded or photocopied versions of an application 
form, we are unable to accept these and the application(s) will be rejected. 

Ensure the application has been completed in black or blue ink and written clearly in 
BLOCK CAPITALS within the boxes provided. 

Don’t please do not send any original documents to Disclosure Scotland, we only 
require photocopies of documents. 

Ensure only one letter or number has been used for each box. The number of boxes 
given for each section indicates the maximum amount of letters/numbers that the 
system will accept. 

 

If you or the applicant make a mistake please ensure it is corrected by either using 
correcting fluid sparingly, or by clearly scoring through the error and by writing the 
answer in the remaining space. If this is not possible, please start a new form. 

 

Ensure the correct PVG Scheme Membership number has been endorsed at B1.  

Ensure supporting documentation has been supplied if the applicant is notifying 
Disclosure Scotland of any changes to their personal details at B7.

The most common errors in relation to an Existing Scheme Member application are listed below. Please look out for these before submitting an application to Disclosure 
Scotland to ensure it has been completed correctly, this will avoid any unnecessary delays to the progress of an application. 
 

 A1 – Level of Disclosure. One of the most common errors at A1 is an applicant applying for a Scheme Record Update for a workforce they haven’t previously 
submitted an application for. For example, if an applicant is a member of the PVG Scheme for children they can only apply for a Scheme Record Update for children. 
If the applicant is now carrying out regulated work for both children and adults they must still complete an existing Scheme Member form but requesting a full 
Scheme Record and pay the appropriate fee. Please note Scheme Membership Statements & Scheme Membership Statements(Countersigned) do not contain 
vetting information but simply confirm the individual is not barred from the relevant workforce.  They are intended for use by individuals and personal 
employers.  If an organisation receives a Scheme Membership Statement because they have requested one in error, and they want a Scheme Record/Scheme 
Record Update, they must submit another application and pay the appropriate fee. 
 

 A2  - Please ensure the correct workforce has been selected in relation to the position applied for. Disclosure Scotland are unable to add a workforce once an 
application has been submitted. The applicant must only apply in relation to the type(s) of regulated work which they will be doing for your organisation (or the 
organisation on whose behalf you are acting). 
 

 B1 – PVG Scheme Membership Number/PVG Scheme ID. An Applicant’s PVG Scheme Membership number is different to a certificate number, the Scheme 
membership number is unique to the individual and will start with the year that they became a member of the PVG Scheme, for example if the applicant initially 
applied in 2014 their membership number will begin with 14. You will find the applicant’s Scheme membership number on their certificate under their name and 
date of birth details and will be 16 digits long. N.B On the top right hand side of a certificate you will see ‘Disclosure Number’ followed by a number beginning with 
‘20000’, please note this is the certificate number and should not be endorsed at B1. 
 

 B7 – Changes to an applicant’s personal details. B7 is often omitted or ‘Yes’ has been selected but no supporting documents have been attached to confirm the 
changes. Please ensure B7 has been marked and if ‘Yes’ has been selected ensure the changes to the applicant’s personal details have been included with the 
application, the changes should be noted on a separate piece of paper with the applicant’s PVG ID number. If B7 has been omitted and confirmed as ‘Yes’ once the 
application has been received by Disclosure Scotland we will require proof of the changes or confirmation from a CSG confirming what document has been seen. 
 

 PART E – Countersignature details. We often find anomalies with Registered Body Names, Registered Body Codes and Countersignatory Names and codes. Where 
applicable please ensure you complete the correct Registered Body details at Part E of the application form (Scheme Record/Updates only). If you are unsure of any 
of the codes relating to yourself or the organisation please contact the Disclosure Scotland Helpline and we will be happy to assist. Please also ensure the signature 
entered at F1 matches the signature you supplied with your initial registration application. If this has changed please notify Disclosure Scotland to allow us to 
update our records, you will be required to complete a modify registration application. Please also note that we often find Countersignatory details have been 
endorsed on the personal employer page in error, if you have completed and signed this section in error and you are looking for a Scheme Record or Scheme 
Record Update a new application will be required as the signature has not been signed at the correct section.

PART A – TYPE OF APPLICATION 
A1 
Ensure the applicant has selected the correct level of Disclosure.  
If you are countersigning an application it is more than likely for a 
Scheme Record or Scheme Record Update. 

 
Scheme Membership Statement: 
Please note Scheme Membership Statements do not contain vetting  
information but simply confirm the individual is not barred from the relevant workforce, they are intended for use by individuals. If an organisation receives a  
Scheme Membership Statement because they have requested one in error, and they want a Scheme Record, they must submit another application and pay  
the appropriate fee. If the applicant has had a Scheme Membership Statement previously they are not eligible to apply for any additional statements for the  
same workforce. 
 
Scheme Record: 
Registered Body details should be completed at Part E, page 5 of the Existing PVG Scheme Member application for all Scheme Records. Please note Scheme 
Record certificates show full vetting information. 
 
Scheme Record Update: 
Registered Body details should be completed at Part E, page 5 of the Existing PVG Scheme Member application for all Scheme Record Updates. Please note 
Scheme Record Update certificates are now called Short Scheme Record Disclosures and they will state whether the applicant is under consideration for  
listing or not under consideration for listing, they will also confirm that no vetting information is held. Where an individual has vetting information Disclosure  
Scotland will issue a full Scheme Record Certificate instead, at no additional cost to the Registered Body. 
An applicant must currently be registered for the PVG Scheme for all type(s) of regulated work to which the application relates (workforce(s) selected at A2). 
This means the applicant must have a Scheme Record for the type(s) of regulated work selected at A2 in order to apply for an update on the initial Scheme 
Record. If the applicant does not have this information it can be provided by the helpdesk once security questions have been answered. 
 
Scheme Membership Statement(Countersigned): 
Please note Scheme Membership Statements (Countersigned) do not contain vetting information but simply confirm the individual is not barred, they are 
intended for use by personal employers.  If an organisation receives a Scheme Membership Statement  because they have requested one in error, and they  
want a Scheme Record, they must submit another application and pay the appropriate fee. An applicant is entitled to apply for more than one Scheme  
Membership Statement (Countersigned).
