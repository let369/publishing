          <p>In January 2021 the transition period will end and our new relationship with the EU will begin. There will be effects on some areas of life in Scotland. </p>

          <p>Scotland has measures in place to protect the environment, and these measures are supported by EU laws and standards. These EU laws and standards may be affected by Brexit.</p>
          <p>The Scottish Government is committed to making sure it meets EU environmental standards after Brexit.</p>
          <p>Environmental legislation is being corrected to make sure the law keeps working as it has been in key areas. The Scottish Government is working on this with public bodies like the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and Scottish Natural Heritage.</p>

          <p>The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020. This process is often known as &#39;Brexit&#39;. </p>
          <p>We&#39;re now in a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/transition">transition period</a> (also known as the implementation period) that&#39;s likely to last until the end of December 2020. This means the UK is currently still following EU rules.</p>
          <p>In January 2021 the transition period will end and our new relationship with the EU will begin. There will be effects on some areas of life in Scotland. </p>
          <p>This may include changes to EU-funded programmes.</p>
          <blockquote>
          <p>The UK is now in the Brexit transition period. This means many of the details about what Brexit will mean are not yet known. This page gives the latest facts, but it will be updated as more details are confirmed. Please keep checking back for new information.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>The following programmes have been identified as having Scottish stakeholders.</p>
          <p>If you need more information on a specific fund, you may be able to find out more using the table below. The UK Government has also published <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/continued-uk-participation-in-eu-programmes">information on continued UK participation in EU programmes</a>.</p>

          <p>The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020. This process is often known as &#39;Brexit&#39;. </p>
          <p>We&#39;re now in a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/transition">transition period</a> (also known as the implementation period) that&#39;s likely to last until the end of December 2020. This means the UK is currently still following EU rules. </p>
          <p>In January 2021 the transition period will end and our new relationship with the EU will begin. There will be effects on some areas of life in Scotland. </p>
          <p>This may include changes to the way family, civil and commercial legal disputes are handled.</p>
          <blockquote>
          <p>The UK is now in the Brexit transition period. This means many of the details about what Brexit will mean are not yet known. This page gives the latest facts, but it will be updated as more details are confirmed. Please keep checking back for new information. </p>
          </blockquote>
          <h2 id="family-law-disputes-involving-eu-countries">Family law disputes involving EU countries</h2>
          <p>If there&#39;s a family dispute where both parties are based in the UK, nothing will change after Brexit except for a small change to when courts in Scotland can deal with divorce cases.</p>
          <p>If a family dispute involves EU countries, however, some of the rules may change after Brexit.</p>
          <p>If we have not agreed an EU trade deal by the end of the Brexit transition period, some EU family law agreements will no longer apply to the UK. </p>
          <p>This will affect rules on:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>the country that family law disputes are heard in</li>
          <li>how decisions made in one country will be recognised and enforced in another</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This applies to cases in Scotland for:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>divorce</li>
          <li>matters relating to children</li>
          <li>child maintenance</li>
          <li>EU rules on child abduction</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you are involved in a case you think may be affected by this (or if you will be soon), you should speak to a lawyer or <a href="https://www.cas.org.uk/">Citizens Advice Bureau</a> as soon as possible.</p>
          <p>There will be no changes to the process until the end of the transition period (December 2020).</p>
          <h3 id="divorce">Divorce</h3>
          <p>At the moment, EU family law decides when courts have &#39;jurisdiction&#39; over a divorce case (when they&#39;re able to deal with it).</p>
          <p>If we reach the end of the transition period without a deal, this will change and the courts will have jurisdiction if either partner:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>is resident in Scotland on the date when the court action starts, or</li>
          <li>was resident in Scotland throughout the period of one year ending on the date when the court action starts.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>There will be similar changes for the &#39;dissolution&#39; of a civil partnership.</p>
          <h2 id="matters-relating-to-children">Matters relating to children</h2>
          <p>Brexit will also affect the EU rules on matters relating to children. This includes:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>parental responsibilities and rights</li>
          <li>contact</li>
          <li>residence</li>
          </ul>
          <p>After Brexit, these EU rules will be replaced by other international rules, which Scotland currently follows in cases involving non-EU countries. These rules are similar to the EU rules.</p>
          <h3 id="family-maintenance">Family maintenance</h3>
          <p>The rules for family maintenance that are currently applied within the EU will be replaced by other existing international rules.</p>
          <p>This means maintenance can still be obtained and enforced between Scotland and EU countries. </p>

          <li>the country that family law disputes are heard in</li>
          <li>how decisions made in one country will be recognised and enforced in another</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This applies to cases in Scotland for:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>divorce</li>
          <li>matters relating to children</li>
          <li>child maintenance</li>
          <li>EU rules on child abduction</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you are involved in a case you think may be affected by this (or if you will be soon), you should speak to a lawyer or <a href="https://www.cas.org.uk/">Citizens Advice Bureau</a> as soon as possible.</p>
          <p>There will be no changes to the process until the end of the transition period (December 2020).</p>
          <h3 id="divorce">Divorce</h3>
          <p>At the moment, EU family law decides when courts have &#39;jurisdiction&#39; over a divorce case (when they&#39;re able to deal with it).</p>
          <p>If we reach the end of the transition period without a deal, this will change and the courts will have jurisdiction if either partner:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>is resident in Scotland on the date when the court action starts, or</li>
          <li>was resident in Scotland throughout the period of one year ending on the date when the court action starts.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>There will be similar changes for the &#39;dissolution&#39; of a civil partnership.</p>
          <h2 id="matters-relating-to-children">Matters relating to children</h2>
          <p>Brexit will also affect the EU rules on matters relating to children. This includes:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>parental responsibilities and rights</li>
          <li>contact</li>
          <li>residence</li>
          </ul>
          <p>After Brexit, these EU rules will be replaced by other international rules, which Scotland currently follows in cases involving non-EU countries. These rules are similar to the EU rules.</p>
          <h3 id="family-maintenance">Family maintenance</h3>
          <p>The rules for family maintenance that are currently applied within the EU will be replaced by other existing international rules.</p>
          <p>This means maintenance can still be obtained and enforced between Scotland and EU countries. </p>
          <p>If you have a child maintenance decision you want to have recognised and enforced in an EU country, as well as speaking to your solicitor you can contact:</p>

          <h3 id="international-parental-child-abduction">International parental child abduction</h3>
          <p>After Brexit, the rules about abduction or wrongfully retained children in EU countries will mostly stay the same.</p>
          <p>If you&#39;re the applicant in a case to return a child who has been abducted to an EU country by a parent or a relative, you should contact:</p>

          <p>If there&#39;s a civil or commercial dispute where both parties are based in the UK, nothing will change after Brexit.</p>
          <p>If a dispute involves EU countries, however, some of the rules may change after Brexit.</p>
          <p>If we have not agreed an EU trade deal by the end of the transition period (a &#39;no deal&#39; situation), some EU civil law agreements will no longer apply to the UK.</p>
          <p>This will affect rules on:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>the country civil and commercial law disputes are heard in</li>
          <li>how decisions made in one country will be recognised and enforced in another</li>

          \ we have in Scotland is produced within Scotland and the UK, some of it\
          \ gets imported into the UK from other countries in the EU and beyond.</p>\
          \ \n  <p>The Scottish Government is working closely with retailers, the\
          \ food industry and others across the supply chain to make sure any disruption\
          \ to the supply of food and drink will be kept to a minimum.</p> \n  <h3\
          \ id=\"if-you-re-struggling-to-afford-food\">If you're struggling to afford\
          \ food</h3> \n  <p>Some families in Scotland struggle to be able to afford\
          \ or access food. This is also known as 'household food insecurity'.</p>\
          \ \n  <p>Brexit may lead to some foods becoming more expensive or harder\
          \ to find, which may affect those who need the most help.</p> \n  <p>The\
          \ Scottish Government continues to look at ways to tackle and respond to\
          \ food insecurity. This includes increasing the Fair Food Fund to £3.5 million\
          \ in 2019-20 and investing an extra £1 million in <a href=\"https://fareshare.org.uk/\"\
          >food redistribution.</a></p> \n  <p>If you're worried about not being able\

          \ be effects on Scottish food and drink producers who export their goods\
          \ to EU countries.</p> \n  <p>Some of these goods (like beef and lamb) could\
          \ face large tariffs.</p> \n  <p>Others, like seafood, may have other barriers,\
          \ like additional certification and delays in getting products to market.\
          \ This could have a financial impact.</p> \n  <p>The Scottish Government\

          <p>The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020. This process is often known as &#39;Brexit&#39;. </p>
          <p>We&#39;re now in a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/transition">transition period</a> (also known as the implementation period) that&#39;s likely to last until the end of December 2020. This means the UK is currently still following EU rules.</p>
          <p>In January 2021 the transition period will end and our new relationship with the EU will begin. There will be effects on some areas of life in Scotland. </p>
          <p>This may include changes to travel to and from EU countries.</p>
          <blockquote>
          <p>The UK is now in the Brexit transition period. This means many of the details about what Brexit will mean are not yet known. This page gives the latest facts, but it will be updated as more details are confirmed. Please keep checking back for new information. </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p> If the transition period ends before an EU trade deal has been agreed (a &#39;no deal&#39; situation), you may need different documents to visit and drive in:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>the EU</li>
          <li>Norway</li>
          <li>Liechtenstein</li>
          <li>Switzerland </li>
          <li>Iceland</li>
          <li>Andorra</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This includes travel to these countries by air, sea, coach, rail or Eurotunnel shuttle. Your legal rights as a passenger will stay the same.</p>
          <p>You may also need to make different arrangements in advance if you plan to travel with a pet. </p>
          <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/visit-europe-1-january-2021">GOV.UK has guidance</a> on this.</p>
          <h2 id="passports">Passports</h2>
          <p> If the transition period ends before an EU trade deal has been agreed (a &#39;no deal&#39; situation), the rules for travel to most countries in Europe will change for UK passport holders.</p>
          <p>If you travel to an EU country after Brexit, you should have at least 6 months left on your passport from the date you arrive. Your passport should also be less than 10 years old.</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/passport-rules-for-travel-to-europe-after-brexit">GOV.UK has guidance</a> which gives more information on which countries this affects.</p>
          <p>The existing Common Travel Area between the UK and Ireland will continue. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/common-travel-area-guidance">GOV.UK has more information on this.</a></p>
          <h2 id="holidays-and-travel">Holidays and travel</h2>
          <p>If you&#39;re planning to travel by air, sea, coach, rail or Eurotunnel shuttle after Brexit, all these services are expected to run as normal after Brexit. However, you should check with your travel company for the latest information before you leave.</p>
          <p>If any of these services are delayed or cancelled, your consumer rights will remain the same.</p>
          <p>The European Commission has said that there will be no difference to travel and holidaymakers won&#39;t need a visa during the &#39;transition period&#39; (where the UK has left the EU but still follows EU rules while the new arrangements are made).</p>
          <p>You may still need to check your passport is valid for at least six months after the date you plan to travel. If you&#39;re travelling with a pet, or planning to drive in mainland Europe, you may need to make extra arrangements as explained on this page. There are still more details to be agreed – this site will be updated when there&#39;s more information.</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/passport-rules-for-travel-to-europe-after-brexit">GOV.UK has more information on this.</a></p>
          <h3 id="travel-insurance">Travel insurance</h3>
          <p>If you have a European Health Insurance Card, it may not be valid after Brexit. You must make sure that you have suitable insurance and healthcare cover, especially if you have a pre-existing condition.</p>
          <h2 id="driving-in-the-eu">Driving in the EU</h2>
          <p>If you&#39;re planning to drive in the EU after Brexit and have a UK Driving Licence, you may need to apply for and carry an International Driving Permit.</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/driving-in-the-eu-after-brexit">GOV.UK has guidance</a> on this.</p>
          <p>You may also need to apply for and carry a Green Card to prove you have third party insurance if you&#39;re driving in:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>the EU</li>
          <li>EEA countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway)</li>
          <li>Andorra, Serbia or Switzerland</li>
          </ul>
          <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/driving-abroad">GOV.UK has guidance</a> on this.</p>
          <h2 id="travelling-with-pets">Travelling with pets</h2>
          <p>If you&#39;re planning to take a pet to an EU country after Brexit, there may be changes that affect you.</p>
          <p>You will not be able to use the pet passport scheme after Brexit and the alternative will take 4 months to arrange.</p>
          <p>You should contact your vet for advice at least 4 months before you travel (or as soon as possible). If the UK leaves the EU in a &#39;no deal&#39; situation, you may need to take extra steps in advance.</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pet-travel-to-europe-after-brexit">GOV.UK has guidance</a> which gives more information on this.</p>
          <h2 id="travelling-as-a-haulier">Travelling as a haulier</h2>
          <p>If you&#39;re travelling in Europe as haulier after Brexit, there may be changes to the rules on licences, permits and qualifications which apply to you.</p>
          <p>Hauliers and commercial drivers will need the correct documentation to drive in the EU should the UK leave without a deal.</p>
          <p>Hauliers will be required to go through customs checks, and it&#39;s the responsibility of traders to make sure that the right paperwork is in place provided for the goods being carried.</p>
          <p>More details of what hauliers will need to do is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/transport-goods-from-uk-by-road">available at GOV.UK.</a> </p>
          <h2 id="more-information">More information</h2>

          <p>The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020. This process is often known as &#39;Brexit&#39;. </p>
          <p>We&#39;re now in a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/transition">transition period</a> (also known as the implementation period) that&#39;s likely to last until the end of December 2020. This means the UK is currently still following EU rules.</p>
          <p>In January 2021 the transition period will end and our new relationship with the EU will begin. There will be effects on some areas of life in Scotland. </p>
          <p>This may include changes to travel to and from EU countries.</p>
          <blockquote>
          <p>The UK is now in the Brexit transition period. This means many of the details about what Brexit will mean are not yet known. This page gives the latest facts, but it will be updated as more details are confirmed. Please keep checking back for new information. </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p> If the transition period ends before an EU trade deal has been agreed (a &#39;no deal&#39; situation), you may need different documents to visit and drive in:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>the EU</li>
          <li>Norway</li>
          <li>Liechtenstein</li>
          <li>Switzerland </li>
          <li>Iceland</li>
          <li>Andorra</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This includes travel to these countries by air, sea, coach, rail or Eurotunnel shuttle. Your legal rights as a passenger will stay the same.</p>
          <p>You may also need to make different arrangements in advance if you plan to travel with a pet. </p>
          <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/visit-europe-1-january-2021">GOV.UK has guidance</a> on this.</p>
          <h2 id="passports">Passports</h2>
          <p> If the transition period ends before an EU trade deal has been agreed (a &#39;no deal&#39; situation), the rules for travel to most countries in Europe will change for UK passport holders.</p>
          <p>If you travel to an EU country after Brexit, you should have at least 6 months left on your passport from the date you arrive. Your passport should also be less than 10 years old.</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/passport-rules-for-travel-to-europe-after-brexit">GOV.UK has guidance</a> which gives more information on which countries this affects.</p>
          <p>The existing Common Travel Area between the UK and Ireland will continue. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/common-travel-area-guidance">GOV.UK has more information on this.</a></p>
          <h2 id="holidays-and-travel">Holidays and travel</h2>
          <p>If you&#39;re planning to travel by air, sea, coach, rail or Eurotunnel shuttle after Brexit, all these services are expected to run as normal after Brexit. However, you should check with your travel company for the latest information before you leave.</p>
          <p>If any of these services are delayed or cancelled, your consumer rights will remain the same.</p>
          <p>The European Commission has said that there will be no difference to travel and holidaymakers won&#39;t need a visa during the &#39;transition period&#39; (where the UK has left the EU but still follows EU rules while the new arrangements are made).</p>
          <p>You may still need to check your passport is valid for at least six months after the date you plan to travel. If you&#39;re travelling with a pet, or planning to drive in mainland Europe, you may need to make extra arrangements as explained on this page. There are still more details to be agreed – this site will be updated when there&#39;s more information.</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/passport-rules-for-travel-to-europe-after-brexit">GOV.UK has more information on this.</a></p>
          <h3 id="travel-insurance">Travel insurance</h3>
          <p>If you have a European Health Insurance Card, it may not be valid after Brexit. You must make sure that you have suitable insurance and healthcare cover, especially if you have a pre-existing condition.</p>
          <h2 id="driving-in-the-eu">Driving in the EU</h2>
          <p>If you&#39;re planning to drive in the EU after Brexit and have a UK Driving Licence, you may need to apply for and carry an International Driving Permit.</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/driving-in-the-eu-after-brexit">GOV.UK has guidance</a> on this.</p>
          <p>You may also need to apply for and carry a Green Card to prove you have third party insurance if you&#39;re driving in:</p>
          <ul>
          <li>the EU</li>
          <li>EEA countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway)</li>
          <li>Andorra, Serbia or Switzerland</li>

          <h2 id="travelling-with-pets">Travelling with pets</h2>
          <p>If you&#39;re planning to take a pet to an EU country after Brexit, there may be changes that affect you.</p>
          <p>You will not be able to use the pet passport scheme after Brexit and the alternative will take 4 months to arrange.</p>
          <p>You should contact your vet for advice at least 4 months before you travel (or as soon as possible). If the UK leaves the EU in a &#39;no deal&#39; situation, you may need to take extra steps in advance.</p>
          <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pet-travel-to-europe-after-brexit">GOV.UK has guidance</a> which gives more information on this.</p>
          <h2 id="travelling-as-a-haulier">Travelling as a haulier</h2>
          <p>If you&#39;re travelling in Europe as haulier after Brexit, there may be changes to the rules on licences, permits and qualifications which apply to you.</p>
          <p>Hauliers and commercial drivers will need the correct documentation to drive in the EU should the UK leave without a deal.</p>
          <p>Hauliers will be required to go through customs checks, and it&#39;s the responsibility of traders to make sure that the right paperwork is in place provided for the goods being carried.</p>
          <p>More details of what hauliers will need to do is <a href="https://www.gov.uk/transport-goods-from-uk-by-road">available at GOV.UK.</a> </p>

        hippostd:content: "<html>\n <head></head>\n <body>\n  <p>The UK left the European\
          \ Union on 31 January 2020. This process is often known as 'Brexit'. </p>\
          \ \n  <p>We're now in a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/transition\">transition\
          \ period</a> (also known as the implementation period) that's likely to\
          \ last until the end of December 2020. This means the UK is currently still\
          \ following EU rules. </p> \n  <p>In January 2021 the transition period\
          \ will end and our new relationship with the EU will begin. There will be\
          \ effects on some areas of life in Scotland.</p> \n  <p>It's still not clear\
          \ what these effects will be. Despite this, the Scottish Government is working\
          \ with the UK Government and public bodies to prepare for possible impacts\
          \ on people and business in Scotland. <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/brexit/\"\
          >Visit the Scottish Government website</a> for more information.</p> \n\
          \  <p>The Scottish Government is looking at two main options for what will\
          \ happen after the transition period ends:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Brexit\
          \ with a trade deal</li> \n   <li>Brexit without a trade deal (a 'no deal'\
          \ situation)</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>The UK Government has proposed a trade\
          \ deal. But it has not yet been ratified (confirmed). This means 'no deal'\
          \ could still happen. </p> \n  <p>You may have questions about what Brexit\
          \ means for you. You might have questions about the availability of medicines\
          \ or food, or how EU citizens living in Scotland may be affected.</p> \n\
          \  <p>This site provides information and guidance to help you prepare for\
          \ Brexit, including a 'no deal' situation. Not all information is available\
          \ at this time. Regular updates will be made to this site as new information\
          \ becomes available.</p> \n  <p>Brexit could include changes to a number\

        hippostd:content: "<html>\n <head></head>\n <body>\n  <p>The UK left the European\
          \ Union on 31 January 2020. This process is often known as 'Brexit'. </p>\
          \ \n  <p>We're now in a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/transition\">transition\
          \ period</a> (also known as the implementation period) that's likely to\
          \ last until the end of December 2020. This means the UK is currently still\
          \ following EU rules. </p> \n  <p>In January 2021 the transition period\
          \ will end and our new relationship with the EU will begin. There will be\
          \ effects on some areas of life in Scotland.</p> \n  <p>It's still not clear\
          \ what these effects will be. Despite this, the Scottish Government is working\
          \ with the UK Government and public bodies to prepare for possible impacts\
          \ on people and business in Scotland. <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/brexit/\"\
          >Visit the Scottish Government website</a> for more information.</p> \n\
          \  <p>The Scottish Government is looking at two main options for what will\
          \ happen after the transition period ends:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>Brexit\
          \ with a trade deal</li> \n   <li>Brexit without a trade deal (a 'no deal'\
          \ situation)</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>The UK Government has proposed a trade\
          \ deal. But it has not yet been ratified (confirmed). This means 'no deal'\
          \ could still happen. </p> \n  <p>You may have questions about what Brexit\
          \ means for you. You might have questions about the availability of medicines\
          \ or food, or how EU citizens living in Scotland may be affected.</p> \n\
          \  <p>This site provides information and guidance to help you prepare for\
          \ Brexit, including a 'no deal' situation. Not all information is available\
          \ at this time. Regular updates will be made to this site as new information\
          \ becomes available.</p> \n  <p>Brexit could include changes to a number\
