      hippostd:content: "<html>\n <head></head>\n <body>\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotland-a-trading-nation/\"\
        >A Trading Nation</a> aims to increase Scotland’s exports by:</p> \n  <ul>\
        \ \n   <li>focussing resources</li> \n   <li>making changes to strategy</li>\
        \ \n   <li>making changes to policy</li> \n   <li>checking how exports perform</li>\
        \ \n  </ul> \n  <h2>Focussing resources</h2> \n  <p>Scotland will increase\
        \ exports by focussing resources where they will have most impact.</p> \n\
        \  <p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotland-a-trading-nation/\"\
        >evidence shows</a> that successful exporting countries:</p> \n  <ul> \n \
        \  <li>focus on a limited range of products and services</li> \n   <li>sell\
        \ to a limited number of countries</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>This is why <a href=\"\
        https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotland-a-trading-nation/\">A Trading Nation</a>\
        \ focusses on <a href=\"index\">key sectors</a> and <a href=\"index\">countries</a>.</p>\
        \ \n  <h2>Top 500 businesses</h2> \n  <p>Scotland will also focus its resources\
        \ around its top 500 exporting businesses.</p> \n  <p>Scotland currently has\
        \ around 11,000 businesses who export. However, the top 500 are responsible\
        \ for 80% of exports.</p> \n  <p>Increasing exports for the top 500 businesses\
        \ could add £13 billion to Scotland’s economy (Gross Domestic Product), while\
        \ increasing exports in the other 10,500 businesses would only add £2.9 billion.</p>\
        \ \n  <p>Increasing exports for these businesses will also benefit the businesses\
        \ who supply them.</p> \n  <h2>Help for new exporters</h2> \n  <p>All businesses\
        \ in Scotland will still be able to get some <a href=\"help-for-businesses\"\
        >help to grow their business and start exporting</a>. This includes businesses\
        \ who are new to exporting.</p> \n  <p>We’re looking at ways we can deliver\
        \ this help in a different way. For example, improving the help and support\
        \ available online.</p> \n  <h2>Working together</h2> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotland-a-trading-nation/\"\
        >A Trading Nation</a> will also focus resources by encouraging organisations\
        \ to work together on the plan’s priorities. This includes:</p> \n  <ul> \n\
        \   <li>the Scottish Government</li> \n   <li>the enterprise agencies</li>\
        \ \n   <li>agencies supporting education, tourism and specific industry sectors</li>\
        \ \n  </ul> \n  <p>By working together, it means businesses can make use of:</p>\
        \ \n  <ul> \n   <li><a href=\"https://www.sdi.co.uk/about-sdi/global-offices\"\
        >Scottish Development International offices</a> in 20 countries</li> \n  \
        \ <li><a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/policies/international-relations/international-offices/\"\
        >Scottish Government offices</a> in Brussels and 8 other countries</li> \n\
        \   <li>Visit Scotland offices in London and Toronto</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Businesses\
        \ will also be able to access wider networks and trade and investment specialists\
        \ across the world. A Trading Nation will use help from:</p> \n  <ul> \n \
        \  <li><a href=\"https://www.globalscot.com/\">GlobalScot</a></li> \n   <li>trade\
        \ envoys</li> \n   <li><a href=\"https://www.scottishchambers.org.uk/\">Chambers\

        >Foreign and Commonwealth Office</a></li> \n  </ul> \n  <h2>Changes to strategy\
        \ and policy</h2> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotland-a-trading-nation/\"\
        >A Trading Nation</a> makes changes to strategy and policy.</p> \n  <p>These\
        \ changes aim to:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>raise awareness of exporting and encourage\
        \ businesses to see it as an ambition</li> \n   <li>build the capacity and\
        \ capabilities of businesses, so they can take up opportunities</li> \n  \
        \ <li>make sure the right support is available to help businesses expand and\
        \ exploit opportunities</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>To do this, <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotland-a-trading-nation/\"\
        >A Trading Nation</a> will:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>improve trade promotion\
        \ as well as Scotland’s overseas profile and reach</li> \n   <li>support businesses\
        \ by refocussing <a href=\"https://www.sdi.co.uk/\">Scottish Development International’\
        s</a> priorities</li> \n  </ul> \n  <h3>Improving trade promotion, profile\
        \ and reach</h3> \n  <p>To do this, <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotland-a-trading-nation/\"\
        >A Trading Nation</a> will:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>expand the <a href=\"https://www.globalscot.com/\"\
        >GlobalScot</a> network from 600 to 2000 business people in key markets. This\
        \ includes doubling to 500 people in Europe by 2020</li> \n   <li>give <a\
        \ href=\"https://www.globalscot.com/\">GlobalScot</a> clearer 'asks' and 'offers'\
        \ of support from <a href=\"https://www.sdi.co.uk/\">Scottish Development\
        \ International</a></li> \n   <li>ask leading Scottish exporters to get involved\
        \ in <a href=\"https://www.scotland.org/\">Scotland Is Now</a> to develop\
        \ a world-class brand for Scotland</li> \n   <li>add in-market specialists\
        \ in <a href=\"index\">key sectors</a>, focussed on <a href=\"where-we-could-sell-more\"\
        >countries with the most opportunities</a></li> \n   <li>continue to do all\
        \ we can to increase our exports with key countries in Europe, regardless\
        \ of the outcome of EU Exit</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>It’ll also look to increase\
        \ trade promotion activity with more international missions and exhibitions.\
        \ This will build on:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><a href=\"https://www.sdi.co.uk/\"\
        >Scottish Development International</a>’s current 68 global events</li> \n\
        \   <li>the <a href=\"https://www.scottishchambers.org.uk/\">Chambers of Commerce’\
        s</a> trade missions through their International Trade Promotion programme</li>\
        \ \n   <li>major international events such as the Rugby World Cup 2019, Dubai\
        \ Expo 2020 and the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo in China 2020</li> \n\
        \  </ul> \n  <h3>Refocussing Scottish Development International’s priorities</h3>\
        \ \n  <p>To do this, <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotland-a-trading-nation/\"\
        >A Trading Nation</a> will help <a href=\"https://www.sdi.co.uk/\">Scottish\
        \ Development International</a> to:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>separate into specialist\

        \ offer the biggest opportunities</li> \n   <li>help existing exporters sell\
        \ in new countries or create new products</li> \n   <li>work with high potential,\
        \ early stage businesses in industries like digital and life sciences</li>\
        \ \n   <li>develop support to help more small businesses who are internationally\
        \ focussed grow quickly. This includes business in the creative and technology\
        \ industries</li> \n   <li>work more closely with the enterprise agencies\
        \ to help more businesses export</li> \n   <li>increase the number of exporting\
        \ businesses. To do this, they’ll work with the <a href=\"https://www.scottishchambers.org.uk/\"\
        >Chambers of Commerce</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bgateway.com/\">Business\
        \ Gateway</a>, sector leadership bodies</li> \n   <li>increase online training,\

        \   <li>improve the skills within businesses through export qualifications\
        \ and access to sales and marketing courses</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>It will\
        \ also improve business networks by:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>giving the <a href=\"\
        https://www.scottishchambers.org.uk/\">Chambers of Commerce</a> up to £2 million\
        \ to run trade missions over 3 years (announced December 2018)</li> \n   <li>supporting\
        \ the <a href=\"https://www.sbn.scot/\">Scottish Business Network</a> to take\

        >A Trading Nation</a> aims to increase Scottish exports by £25 billion by\
        \ 2029.</p> \n  <p>To understand how we’re meeting this target, we’ll track\

        \ of exports to particular countries</li> \n   <li>value of exports from particular\

      hippostd:content: "<html>\n <head></head>\n <body>\n  <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotland-a-trading-nation/\"\
        >A Trading Nation</a> aims to increase Scotland’s exports by:</p> \n  <ul>\
        \ \n   <li>focussing resources</li> \n   <li>making changes to strategy</li>\
        \ \n   <li>making changes to policy</li> \n   <li>checking how exports perform</li>\
        \ \n  </ul> \n  <h2>Focussing resources</h2> \n  <p>Scotland will increase\
        \ exports by focussing resources where they will have most impact.</p> \n\
        \  <p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotland-a-trading-nation/\"\
        >evidence shows</a> that successful exporting countries:</p> \n  <ul> \n \
        \  <li>focus on a limited range of products and services</li> \n   <li>sell\
        \ to a limited number of countries</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>This is why <a href=\"\
        https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotland-a-trading-nation/\">A Trading Nation</a>\
        \ focusses on <a href=\"index\">key sectors</a> and <a href=\"index\">countries</a>.</p>\
        \ \n  <h2>Top 500 businesses</h2> \n  <p>Scotland will also focus its resources\
        \ around its top 500 exporting businesses.</p> \n  <p>Scotland currently has\
        \ around 11,000 businesses who export. However, the top 500 are responsible\
        \ for 80% of exports.</p> \n  <p>Increasing exports for the top 500 businesses\
        \ could add £13 billion to Scotland’s economy (Gross Domestic Product), while\
        \ increasing exports in the other 10,500 businesses would only add £2.9 billion.</p>\
        \ \n  <p>Increasing exports for these businesses will also benefit the businesses\
        \ who supply them.</p> \n  <h2>Help for new exporters</h2> \n  <p>All businesses\
        \ in Scotland will still be able to get some <a href=\"help-for-businesses\"\
        >help to grow their business and start exporting</a>. This includes businesses\
        \ who are new to exporting.</p> \n  <p>We’re looking at ways we can deliver\
        \ this help in a different way. For example, improving the help and support\
        \ available online.</p> \n  <h2>Working together</h2> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotland-a-trading-nation/\"\
        >A Trading Nation</a> will also focus resources by encouraging organisations\
        \ to work together on the plan’s priorities. This includes:</p> \n  <ul> \n\
        \   <li>the Scottish Government</li> \n   <li>the enterprise agencies</li>\
        \ \n   <li>agencies supporting education, tourism and specific industry sectors</li>\
        \ \n  </ul> \n  <p>By working together, it means businesses can make use of:</p>\
        \ \n  <ul> \n   <li><a href=\"https://www.sdi.co.uk/about-sdi/global-offices\"\
        >Scottish Development International offices</a> in 20 countries</li> \n  \
        \ <li><a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/policies/international-relations/international-offices/\"\
        >Scottish Government offices</a> in Brussels and 8 other countries</li> \n\
        \   <li>Visit Scotland offices in London and Toronto</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Businesses\
        \ will also be able to access wider networks and trade and investment specialists\
        \ across the world. A Trading Nation will use help from:</p> \n  <ul> \n \
        \  <li><a href=\"https://www.globalscot.com/\">GlobalScot</a></li> \n   <li>trade\
        \ envoys</li> \n   <li><a href=\"https://www.scottishchambers.org.uk/\">Chambers\
        \ of Commerce</a></li> \n   <li>the <a href=\"https://www.britishcouncil.org/\"\
        >British Council</a></li> \n   <li>the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-international-trade\"\
        >Department for International Trade</a></li> \n   <li>the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-office\"\
        >Foreign and Commonwealth Office</a></li> \n  </ul> \n  <h2>Changes to strategy\
        \ and policy</h2> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotland-a-trading-nation/\"\
        >A Trading Nation</a> makes changes to strategy and policy.</p> \n  <p>These\
        \ changes aim to:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>raise awareness of exporting and encourage\
        \ businesses to see it as an ambition</li> \n   <li>build the capacity and\
        \ capabilities of businesses, so they can take up opportunities</li> \n  \
        \ <li>make sure the right support is available to help businesses expand and\
        \ exploit opportunities</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>To do this, <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotland-a-trading-nation/\"\
        >A Trading Nation</a> will:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>improve trade promotion\
        \ as well as Scotland’s overseas profile and reach</li> \n   <li>support businesses\
        \ by refocussing <a href=\"https://www.sdi.co.uk/\">Scottish Development International’\
        s</a> priorities</li> \n  </ul> \n  <h3>Improving trade promotion, profile\
        \ and reach</h3> \n  <p>To do this, <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotland-a-trading-nation/\"\
        >A Trading Nation</a> will:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>expand the <a href=\"https://www.globalscot.com/\"\
        >GlobalScot</a> network from 600 to 2000 business people in key markets. This\
        \ includes doubling to 500 people in Europe by 2020</li> \n   <li>give <a\
        \ href=\"https://www.globalscot.com/\">GlobalScot</a> clearer 'asks' and 'offers'\
        \ of support from <a href=\"https://www.sdi.co.uk/\">Scottish Development\
        \ International</a></li> \n   <li>ask leading Scottish exporters to get involved\
        \ in <a href=\"https://www.scotland.org/\">Scotland Is Now</a> to develop\
        \ a world-class brand for Scotland</li> \n   <li>add in-market specialists\
        \ in <a href=\"index\">key sectors</a>, focussed on <a href=\"where-we-could-sell-more\"\
        >countries with the most opportunities</a></li> \n   <li>continue to do all\
        \ we can to increase our exports with key countries in Europe, regardless\
        \ of the outcome of EU Exit</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>It’ll also look to increase\
        \ trade promotion activity with more international missions and exhibitions.\
        \ This will build on:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><a href=\"https://www.sdi.co.uk/\"\
        >Scottish Development International</a>’s current 68 global events</li> \n\
        \   <li>the <a href=\"https://www.scottishchambers.org.uk/\">Chambers of Commerce’\
        s</a> trade missions through their International Trade Promotion programme</li>\
        \ \n   <li>major international events such as the Rugby World Cup 2019, Dubai\
        \ Expo 2020 and the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo in China 2020</li> \n\
        \  </ul> \n  <h3>Refocussing Scottish Development International’s priorities</h3>\
        \ \n  <p>To do this, <a href=\"https://www.gov.scot/publications/scotland-a-trading-nation/\"\
        >A Trading Nation</a> will help <a href=\"https://www.sdi.co.uk/\">Scottish\
        \ Development International</a> to:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li>separate into specialist\
        \ divisions for exporting and attracting investments. This builds on a successful\
        \ pilot in the food and drink sector</li> \n   <li>focus their resources on\
        \ key <a href=\"index\">countries</a> and <a href=\"index\">sectors</a> that\
        \ offer the biggest opportunities</li> \n   <li>help existing exporters sell\
        \ in new countries or create new products</li> \n   <li>work with high potential,\
        \ early stage businesses in industries like digital and life sciences</li>\
        \ \n   <li>develop support to help more small businesses who are internationally\
        \ focussed grow quickly. This includes business in the creative and technology\
        \ industries</li> \n   <li>work more closely with the enterprise agencies\
        \ to help more businesses export</li> \n   <li>increase the number of exporting\
