        <p>It protects adults – people aged 16 or over – who can't make some or all decisions for themselves.</p>

        <p>It allows a person (or more than one) – like a relative, friend, partner, or a professional, such as a
            solicitor or accountant – or the local council to make decisions on someone's behalf. </p>

        <p>Those appointed to help are called <a href="/setting-up-power-of-attorney/">attorneys</a> or <a
                href="/setting-up-guardianship/">guardians</a>. They can help people:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>make welfare decisions</li>
            <li>and/or make decisions about property or financial matters</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Act focuses on the individual needs of the adult in question. It restricts what an attorney or guardian
            can do. For example, a welfare attorney or guardian can't agree to certain treatments for the person they're
            acting for against their will.</p>

        <p>The Act puts measures in place for people:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>in case they lose capacity in the future</li>
            <li>or when an adult has already lost capacity</li>
        </ul>
