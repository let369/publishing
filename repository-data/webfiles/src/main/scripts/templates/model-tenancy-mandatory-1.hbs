In order to increase the rent, the Landlord must give the Tenant a rent-increase notice, the content of which is set out in ‘The Private Residential Tenancies (Prescribed Notices and Forms) (Scotland) Regulations 2017’. The notice will be sent using the communication method agreed in the ‘Communication’ clause above.</p>

            <p>Within 21 days of receiving a rent-increase notice, the Tenant can refer the increase to a rent officer for adjudication if he or she considers that the rent increase amount is unreasonable, unless the property is located in a rent pressure zone (RPZ).  Before submitting a referral to a rent officer for rent adjudication, the Tenant must complete Part 3 of the rent-increase notice and return it to his or her Landlord to notify the Landlord of his or her intention to make a referral to a rent officer.   Failure to return Part 3 to the Landlord will mean that the rent increase will take effect from the date proposed in the notice.</p>

            <p>If the Let property is located within a rent pressure zone, the Tenant cannot refer a rent increase to a rent officer as Scottish Ministers will have set a cap on the maximum amount the rent can be increased.  </p>

            <p>Where it is provided in this Agreement that the Tenant is responsible for a particular cost or to do any particular thing and the Tenant fails to meet that cost, or the Landlord carries out work or performs any other obligation for which the Tenant is responsible, the Landlord can apply for reasonable costs to be deducted from any deposit paid by the Tenant. </p>

            <p>This would include cases where a tenant has not paid all of the rent payable, any amount in respect of one-off services, or unpaid utility bills, or a sum in relation to breakages or cleaning.</p>

            <p>At the end of the tenancy the Landlord should ask the tenancy deposit scheme to release the deposit and the amounts payable to each party. If the Tenant disagrees with the amount, the scheme administrator will provide a dispute resolution mechanism.</p>

            <p>Where the Tenant owes the Landlord an amount greater than the amount held by the tenancy deposit scheme, the Tenant will remain liable for these costs, and the Landlord may take action to recover the difference from the Tenant.</p>

            <h3>THE REPAIRING STANDARD</h3>

            <p>The Landlord is responsible for ensuring that the Let Property meets the Repairing Standard. </p>

            <p>The Landlord must carry out a pre-tenancy check of the Let Property to identify work required to meet the Repairing Standard (described below) and notify the Tenant of any such work. The Landlord also has a duty to repair and maintain the Let Property from the start date of the tenancy and throughout the tenancy. This includes a duty to make good any damage caused by doing this work. On becoming aware of a defect, the Landlord must complete the work within a reasonable time.</p>

            <p>A privately rented Let Property must meet the Repairing Standard as follows:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The Let Property must be wind and water tight and in all other respects reasonably fit for people to live in.</li>
                <li>The structure and exterior (including drains, gutters and external pipes) must be in a reasonable state of repair and in proper working order.</li>
                <li>Installations for supplying water, gas and electricity and for sanitation, space heating and heating water must be in a reasonable state of repair and in proper working order.</li>
                <li>Any fixtures, fittings and appliances that the Landlord provides under the tenancy must be in a reasonable state of repair and in proper working order.</li>
                <li>Any furnishings that the Landlord provides under the tenancy must be capable of being used safely for the purpose for which they are designed.</li>
                <li>The Let Property must have a satisfactory way of detecting fires and for giving warning in the event of a fire or suspected fire.</li>
                <li>The Let Property must have a satisfactory way of giving warning if there is a hazardous concentration of carbon monoxide gas. </li>
            </ul>

            <p>More detail on the Repairing Standard is available in the Easy Read Notes for the Scottish Government Model Private Residential Tenancy Agreement, or on the Scottish Government website. If the Tenant believes that the Landlord has failed to ensure that the Let Property meets the Repairing Standard at all times during the tenancy, he or she should discuss this with the Landlord in the first instance. If the Landlord does not rectify the problem within a reasonable time, the Tenant has the right to apply to the First-tier Tribunal for Scotland Housing and Property Chamber (“the Tribunal”). The Tribunal may reject the application; consider whether the case can be resolved by the Tenant and Landlord (for example, by agreeing to mediation); consider the application; or reject the case. The Tribunal has power to require a Landlord to carry out work necessary to meet the Repairing Standard.</p>

            <p>The Repairing Standard does not cover work for which the Tenant is responsible due to his or her duty to use the Let Property in a proper manner; nor does it cover the repair or maintenance of anything that the Tenant is entitled to remove from the Let Property.</p>

            <p>Structure &amp; exterior:</p>

            <p>The Landlord is responsible (together with any other owners of common parts of the building in which the accommodation is situated, if appropriate) for keeping in repair the structure and exterior of the accommodation.</p>

            <p>Gas safety:</p>

            <p>The Landlord must ensure that there is an annual Gas safety check on all pipework and appliances carried out by a Gas Safe registered engineer. The Tenant must be given a copy of the Landlord’s gas safety certificate. The Landlord must keep certificates for at least 2 years. The Gas Safety (Installation and use) Regulations 1998 places duties on Tenants to report any defects with gas pipework or gas appliances that they are aware of to the Landlord. Tenants are forbidden to use appliances that have been deemed unsafe by a gas contractor.</p>

            <p>The Landlord must also ensure that a carbon monoxide detector is installed where there is a fixed carbon-fuelled appliance ( excluding an appliance used solely for cooking ) or where a fixed carbon-fuelled appliance is situated in an inter-connected space such as a garage. A carbon monoxide detector is also required in the bedrooms and main living room if a flue from a carbon-fuelled appliance passes through the room. “Carbon-fuelled” includes wood, coal and oil as well as gas.</p>

            <p>Electrical safety:</p>

            <p>The Landlord must ensure that an electrical safety inspection is carried out at least every five years consisting of an Electrical Installation Condition Report (EICR) and Portable Appliance Testing (PAT) on appliances provided by the Landlord. The EICR must be completed by a suitably competent person.</p>

            <p>The Tenant must be given a copy of the EICR and any PAT.</p>

            <p>Smoke detectors:</p>

            <p>The Landlord must ensure that mains powered smoke alarms are installed in (i) the room which is frequently used by the occupants for general daytime living purposes and (ii) every circulation space such as hallways or landings, there must also be a heat alarm in the kitchen. All alarms should be interlinked.</p>

            <p>Installations: </p>

            <p>The Landlord will keep in repair and in proper working order the installations in the Let Property for the supply of water, gas, electricity, sanitation, space heating and water heating (with the exception of those installed by the Tenant or which the Tenant is entitled to remove).</p>

            <p>Energy Performance Certificate (EPC):</p>

            <p>A valid EPC (not more than 10 years old) must be given to the Tenant at the start date of the tenancy, unless the Tenant is renting a room with shared access to a kitchen, bathroom and living area.</p>

            <p>Furnishings:</p>

            <p>Landlords should ensure that all upholstered furniture provided complies with the Furniture and Furnishings (Fire Safety) Regulations 1988 as amended, as evidenced by the permanent labelling. </p>

            <p>Defective fixtures and fittings:</p>

            <p>All fixtures and fittings provided by the Landlord in the Let Property should be in a reasonable state of repair and in proper working order. The Landlord will repair or replace any of the fixtures, fittings or furnishings supplied which become defective and will do so within a reasonable period of time.  Nothing contained in this Agreement makes the Landlord responsible for repairing damage caused wilfully or negligently by the Tenant, anyone living with the Tenant or an invited visitor to the Let Property.</p>

            <h3>REPAIR TIMETABLE</h3>

            <p>The Tenant undertakes to notify the Landlord as soon as is reasonably practicable of the need for any repair or emergency. The Landlord is responsible for carrying out necessary repairs as soon as is reasonably practicable after having been notified of the need to do so.</p>

            <p>The Tenant must allow the Landlord reasonable access to the Let Property to enable the Landlord to fulfil their duties under the repairing standard (see the clause on ‘Access for Repairs’). </p>

            <h3>PAYMENT FOR REPAIRS</h3>

            <p>The Tenant will be liable for the cost of repairs where the need for them is attributable to his or her fault or negligence, that of any person residing with him or her, or any guest of his or hers. </p>

            <h3>INFORMATION</h3>

            <p>In addition to this Agreement, the Landlord must give to the Tenant:-</p>

Authorised purposes are carrying out work in the Let Property which the Landlord is required to or is allowed to, either by law, under the terms of this Agreement, or any other agreement between the Landlord and the Tenant; inspecting the Let Property to see if any such work is needed; and carrying out a valuation of the Let Property. The right of access also covers access by others such as a contractor or tradesman hired by the Landlord.  </p>
